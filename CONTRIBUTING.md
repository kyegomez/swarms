## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following standards.

### Type Annotations

- **Mandatory**: All functions and methods must have type annotations.
- **Example**:

  ```python
  def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Improves code readability.
  - Helps with static type checking tools.

### Docstrings and Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Every public class, function, and method must have a docstring following the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) or [NumPy Docstring Standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
- **Content**:
  - **Description**: Briefly describe what the function or class does.
  - **Args**: List and describe each parameter.
  - **Returns**: Describe the return value(s).
  - **Raises**: List any exceptions that are raised.

- **Example**:

  ```python
  def calculate_mean(values: List[float]) -> float:
      """
      Calculates the mean of a list of numbers.

      Args:
          values (List[float]): A list of numerical values.

      Returns:
          float: The mean of the input values.

      Raises:
          ValueError: If the input list is empty.
      """
      if not values:
          raise ValueError("The input list is empty.")
      return sum(values) / len(values)
  ```

- **Documentation**: Update or create documentation pages if your changes affect the public API.

### Testing

- **Required**: All new features and bug fixes must include appropriate unit tests.
- **Framework**: Use `unittest`, `pytest`, or a similar testing framework.
- **Test Location**: Place tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of `swarms/`.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability.
- **Running Tests**: Provide instructions for running tests.

  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

### Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines.
- **Linting Tools**: Use `flake8`, `black`, or `pylint` to check code style.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase.
