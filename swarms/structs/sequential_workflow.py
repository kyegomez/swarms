class SequentialWorkflow:
    """
    Orchestrates the execution of a sequence of agents in a defined workflow.

    This class enables the construction and execution of a workflow where multiple agents
    (or callables) are executed in a specified order, passing tasks and optional data
    through the chain. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution, as well as
    batched and concurrent task processing.

    Attributes:
        id (str): Unique identifier for the workflow instance.
        name (str): Human-readable name for the workflow.
        description (str): Description of the workflow's purpose.
        agents (List[Union[Agent, Callable]]): List of agents or callables to execute in sequence.
        max_loops (int): Maximum number of times to execute the workflow.
        output_type (OutputType): Format of the output from the workflow.
        shared_memory_system (callable): Optional callable for managing shared memory between agents.
        multi_agent_collab_prompt (bool): Whether to append a collaborative prompt to each agent.
        flow (str): String representation of the agent execution order.
        agent_rearrange (AgentRearrange): Internal helper for managing agent execution.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the agents list is None or empty, or if max_loops is set to 0.
