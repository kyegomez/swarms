## Agent Failure Protocol

### 1. Overview
Agent failures may arise from bugs, unexpected inputs, or external system changes. This protocol aims to diagnose, address, and prevent such failures.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- **Data Collection**: Record the task, inputs, and environmental variables present during the failure.
- **Diagnostic Tests**: Run the agent in a controlled environment replicating the failure scenario.
- **Error Logging**: Analyze error logs to identify patterns or anomalies.

### 3. Solution Brainstorming
- **Code Review**: Examine the code sections linked to the failure for bugs or inefficiencies.
- **External Dependencies**: Check if external systems or data sources have changed.
- **Algorithmic Analysis**: Evaluate if the agent's algorithms were overwhelmed or faced an unhandled scenario.

### 4. Risk Analysis & Solution Ranking
- Assess the potential risks associated with each solution.
- Rank solutions based on:
  - Implementation complexity
  - Potential negative side effects
  - Resource requirements
- Assign a success probability score (0.0 to 1.0) based on the above factors.

### 5. Solution Implementation
- Implement the top 3 solutions sequentially, starting with the highest success probability.
- If all three solutions fail, trigger the "Human-in-the-Loop" protocol.

## Swarm Failure Protocol

### 1. Overview
Swarm failures are more complex, often resulting from inter-agent conflicts, systemic bugs, or large-scale environmental changes. This protocol delves deep into such failures to ensure the swarm operates optimally.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- **Inter-Agent Analysis**: Examine if agents were in conflict or if there was a breakdown in collaboration.
- **System Health Checks**: Ensure all system components supporting the swarm are operational.
- **Environment Analysis**: Investigate if external factors or systems impacted the swarm's operation.

### 3. Solution Brainstorming
- **Collaboration Protocols**: Review and refine how agents collaborate.
- **Resource Allocation**: Check if the swarm had adequate computational and memory resources.
- **Feedback Loops**: Ensure agents are effectively learning from each other.

### 4. Risk Analysis & Solution Ranking
- Assess the potential systemic risks posed by each solution.
- Rank solutions considering:
  - Scalability implications
  - Impact on individual agents
  - Overall swarm performance potential
- Assign a success probability score (0.0 to 1.0) based on the above considerations.

### 5. Solution Implementation
- Implement the top 3 solutions sequentially, prioritizing the one with the highest success probability.
- If all three solutions are unsuccessful, invoke the "Human-in-the-Loop" protocol for expert intervention.
