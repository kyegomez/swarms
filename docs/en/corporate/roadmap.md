## The Plan

### Phase 1: Building the Foundation
In the first phase, our focus is on building the basic infrastructure of Swarms. This includes developing key components like the Swarms class, integrating essential tools, and establishing task completion and evaluation logic. We'll also start developing our testing and evaluation framework during this phase. If you're interested in foundational work and have a knack for building robust, scalable systems, this phase is for you.

### Phase 2: Optimizing the System
In the second phase, we'll focus on optimizng Swarms by integrating more advanced features, improving the system's efficiency, and refining our testing and evaluation framework. This phase involves more complex tasks, so if you enjoy tackling challenging problems and contributing to the development of innovative features, this is the phase for you.

### Phase 3: Towards Super-Intelligence
The third phase of our bounty program is the most exciting - this is where we aim to achieve super-intelligence. In this phase, we'll be working on improving the swarm's capabilities, expanding its skills, and fine-tuning the system based on real-world testing and feedback. If you're excited about the future of AI and want to contribute to a project that could potentially transform the digital world, this is the phase for you.

Remember, our roadmap is a guide, and we encourage you to bring your own ideas and creativity to the table. We believe that every contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference. So join us on this exciting journey and help us create the future of Swarms.
