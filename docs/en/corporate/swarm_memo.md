# [Go To Market Strategy][GTM]

Our vision is to become the world leader in real-world production grade autonomous agent deployment through open-source product development, Deep Verticalization, and unmatched value delivery to the end user.

We will focus on first accelerating the open source framework to PMF where it will serve as the backend for upstream products and services such as the Swarm Cloud which will enable enterprises to deploy autonomous agents with long term memory and tools in the cloud and a no-code platform for users to build their own swarm by dragging and dropping blocks.

Our target user segment for the framework is AI engineers looking to deploy agents into high risk environments where reliability is crucial. 

Once PMF has been achieved and the framework has been extensively benchmarked we aim to establish high value contracts with customers in Security, Logistics, Manufacturing, Health and various other untapped industries.

Our growth strategy for the OS framework can be summarized by:

- Educating developers on value of autonomous agent usage.
- Tutorial Walkthrough on various applications like deploying multi-modal agents through cameras or building custom swarms for a specific business operation.
- Demonstrate unmatched reliability by delighting users.
- Staying up to date with trends and integrating the latest models, frameworks, and methodologies.
- Building a loyal and devoted community for long term user retention. [Join here](https://codex.apac.ai)

As we continuously deliver value with the open framework we will strategically position ourselves to acquire leads for high value contracts by demonstrating the power, reliability, and performance of our framework openly.
