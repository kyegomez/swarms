## **Introdution**
Swarms provides automation-as-a-service through swarms of autonomous agents that work together as a team. We enable our customers to build, deploy, and scale production-grade multi-agent applications to automate real-world tasks.

### **Vision**
Our vision for 2024 is to provide the most reliable infrastructure for deploying autonomous agents into the real world through the Swarm Cloud, our premier cloud platform for the scalable deployment of Multi-Modal Autonomous Agents. The platform focuses on delivering maximum value to users by only taking a small fee when utilizing the agents for the hosted compute power needed to host the agents.

### **Executive Summary**
The Swarm Corporation aims to enable AI models to automate complex workflows and operations, not just singular low-value tasks. We believe collaboration between multiple agents can overcome limitations of individual agents for reasoning, planning, etc. This will allow automation of processes in mission-critical industries like security, logistics, and manufacturing where AI adoption is currently low.  

We provide an open source framework to deploy production-grade multi-modal agents in just a few lines of code. This builds our user base, recruits talent, gets customer feedback to improve products, gains awareness and trust.

Our business model focuses on customer satisfaction, openness, integration with other tools/platforms, and production-grade reliability. 

Go-to-market strategy is to get the framework to product-market fit with over 50K weekly recurring users, then secure high-value contracts in target industries. Long-term monetization via microtransactions, usage-based pricing, subscriptions.

The team has thousands of hours building and optimizing autonomous agents. Leadership includes AI engineers, product experts, open source contributors and community builders.

Key milestones: get 80K framework users in January 2024, start contracts in target verticals, introduce commercial products in 2025 with various pricing models.
