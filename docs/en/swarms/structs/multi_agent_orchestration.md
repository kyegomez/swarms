# Multi-Agent Orchestration:
Swarms was designed to faciliate the communication between many different and specialized agents from a vast array of other frameworks such as langchain, autogen, crew, and more.

In traditional swarm theory, there are many types of swarms usually for very specialized use-cases and problem sets. Such as Hiearchical and sequential are great for accounting and sales, because there is usually a boss coordinator agent that distributes a workload to other specialized agents.

| Hierarchical Swarms           | A system where agents are organized in a hierarchy, with higher-level agents coordinating lower-level agents to achieve complex tasks.                                   | [Code Link](#)              | Manufacturing process optimization, multi-level sales management, healthcare resource coordination |
| Agent Rearrange               | A setup where agents rearrange themselves dynamically based on the task requirements and environmental conditions.                                                       | [Code Link](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/)              | Adaptive manufacturing lines, dynamic sales territory realignment, flexible healthcare staffing  |
| Concurrent Workflows          | Agents perform different tasks simultaneously, coordinating to complete a larger goal.                                                                                  | [Code Link](#)              | Concurrent production lines, parallel sales operations, simultaneous patient care processes       |
| Sequential Coordination       | Agents perform tasks in a specific sequence, where the completion of one task triggers the start of the next.                                                           | [Code Link](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)              | Step-by-step assembly lines, sequential sales processes, stepwise patient treatment workflows     |
| Parallel Processing           | Agents work on different parts of a task simultaneously to speed up the overall process.                                                                                | [Code Link](#)              | Parallel data processing in manufacturing, simultaneous sales analytics, concurrent medical tests  |
