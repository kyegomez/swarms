# MultiAgentRouter Documentation

The MultiAgentRouter is a sophisticated task routing system that efficiently delegates tasks to specialized AI agents. It uses a "boss" agent to analyze incoming tasks and route them to the most appropriate specialized agent based on their capabilities and expertise.

        model_name="openai/gpt-4o"
    )
]

# Initialize legal router
legal_router = MultiAgentRouter(
    name="Legal-Router",
    description="Routes legal analysis and compliance tasks",
    agents=legal_agents
)

# Example usage for legal department
contract_analysis = legal_router.route_task(
    """Review the following software licensing agreement:
    [contract text]
    
    Analyze for:
    1. Key terms and conditions
    2. Potential risks and liabilities
    3. Compliance with current regulations
    4. Suggested modifications"""
)
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

1. Always use try-except blocks for task routing:
```python
try:
    result = router.route_task(task)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Task routing failed: {str(e)}")
```

2. Monitor agent performance:
```python
if result["execution"]["execution_time"] > 5.0:
    logger.warning(f"Long execution time for task: {result['task']['original']}")
```

3. Implement rate limiting for concurrent tasks:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    results = router.concurrent_batch_route(tasks)
```

4. Regular agent validation:
```python
for agent in router.agents.values():
    if not agent.validate():
        logger.error(f"Agent validation failed: {agent.name}")
```

## Performance Considerations

1. Task Batching

- Group similar tasks together

- Use concurrent_batch_route for independent tasks

- Monitor memory usage with large batches

2. Model Selection

- Choose appropriate models based on task complexity

- Balance speed vs. accuracy requirements

- Consider cost implications

3. Response Caching

- Implement caching for frequently requested analyses

- Use shared memory system for repeated queries

- Regular cache invalidation for time-sensitive data

## Security Considerations

1. Data Privacy

- Implement data encryption

- Handle sensitive information appropriately

- Regular security audits

2. Access Control

- Implement role-based access

- Audit logging

- Regular permission reviews

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Performance Metrics

- Response times

- Success rates

- Error rates

- Resource utilization

2. Logging

- Use structured logging

- Implement log rotation

- Regular log analysis

3. Alerts

- Set up alerting for critical errors

- Monitor resource usage

- Track API rate limits
