Whether you're building a chatbot, a content generation system, or any other AI-powered solution, Azure OpenAI offers a robust and scalable solution for production-grade deployment.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up and deploying Azure OpenAI in a production environment. We'll dive deep into the code, provide clear explanations, and share best practices to ensure a smooth and successful implementation.

## Prerequisites:
Before we begin, it's essential to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You'll need to have Python installed on your system. This guide assumes you're using Python 3.6 or later.
2. **Azure Subscription**: You'll need an active Azure subscription to access Azure OpenAI services.
3. **Azure OpenAI Resource**: Create an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.
4. **Python Packages**: Install the required Python packages, including `python-dotenv` and `swarms`.

## Setting up the Environment:
To kick things off, we'll set up our development environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's a best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies from the rest of your system. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or any other virtual environment management tool of your choice.

```
python -m venv myenv
```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment to ensure that any packages you install are isolated within the environment.

```
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the `python-dotenv` and `swarms` packages using pip.

```
pip install python-dotenv swarms
```

4. **Create a `.env` File**: In the root directory of your project, create a new file called `.env`. This file will store your Azure OpenAI credentials and configuration settings.

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your_azure_openai_endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=<your_azure_openai_deployment_name>
OPENAI_API_VERSION=<your_openai_api_version>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_openai_api_key>
AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN=<your_azure_openai_ad_token>
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials and configuration settings.

## Connecting to Azure OpenAI:
Now that we've set up our environment, let's dive into the code that connects to Azure OpenAI and interacts with the language model.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import AzureOpenAI

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Create an instance of the AzureOpenAI class
model = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
    openai_api_version=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_ad_token=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN")
)
```

## Let's break down this code:

1. **Import Statements**: We import the necessary modules, including `os` for interacting with the operating system, `load_dotenv` from `python-dotenv` to load environment variables, and `AzureOpenAI` from `swarms` to interact with the Azure OpenAI service.

2. **Load Environment Variables**: We use `load_dotenv()` to load the environment variables stored in the `.env` file we created earlier.

3. **Create AzureOpenAI Instance**: We create an instance of the `AzureOpenAI` class by passing in the required configuration parameters:
   - `azure_endpoint`: The endpoint URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.
   - `deployment_name`: The name of the deployment you want to use.
   - `openai_api_version`: The version of the OpenAI API you want to use.
   - `openai_api_key`: Your Azure OpenAI API key, which authenticates your requests.
   - `azure_ad_token`: An optional Azure Active Directory (AAD) token for additional security.

Querying the Language Model:
With our connection to Azure OpenAI established, we can now query the language model and receive responses.

```python
# Define the prompt
prompt = "Analyze this load document and assess it for any risks and create a table in markdwon format."

# Generate a response
response = model(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Here's what's happening:

1. **Define the Prompt**: We define a prompt, which is the input text or question we want to feed into the language model.

2. **Generate a Response**: We call the `model` instance with the `prompt` as an argument. This triggers the Azure OpenAI service to process the prompt and generate a response.

3. **Print the Response**: Finally, we print the response received from the language model.

Running the Code:
To run the code, save it in a Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and execute it from the command line:

```
python main.py
```

## Best Practices for Production Deployment:
While the provided code serves as a basic example, there are several best practices to consider when deploying Azure OpenAI in a production environment:

1. **Secure Credentials Management**: Instead of storing sensitive credentials like API keys in your codebase, consider using secure storage solutions like Azure Key Vault or environment variables managed by your cloud provider.

## Building Analyst Agents with Swarms to write Business Reports

> Jupyter Notebook accompanying this post is accessible at: [Business Analyst Agent Notebook](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/examples/demos/business_analysis_swarm/business-analyst-agent.ipynb)

Solving a business problem often involves preparing a Business Case Report. This report comprehensively analyzes the problem, evaluates potential solutions, and provides evidence-based recommendations and an implementation plan to effectively address the issue and drive business value. While the process of preparing one requires an experienced business analyst, the workflow can be augmented using AI agents. Two candidates stick out as areas to work on:

- Developing an outline to solve the problem
- Doing background research and gathering data 
  
In this post, we will explore how Swarms agents can be used to tackle a busuiness problem by outlining the solution, conducting background research and generating a preliminary report.

Before we proceed, this blog uses 3 API tools. Please obtain the following keys and store them in a `.env` file in the same folder as this file.

- **[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)** as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **[TavilyAI API](https://app.tavily.com/home)** `TAVILY_API_KEY`
- **[KayAI API](https://www.kay.ai/)** as `KAY_API_KEY`

```python
import dotenv
dotenv.load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
```

### Developing an Outline to solve the problem

Assume the business problem is: **How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?** We first create a planning agent to break down the problem into dependent sub-problems.


#### Step 1. Defining the Data Model and Tool Schema

Using Pydantic, we define a structure to help the agent generate sub-problems. 

- **QueryType:** Questions are either standalone or involve a combination of multiple others
- **Query:** Defines structure of a question.
- **QueryPlan:** Allows generation of a dependency graph of sub-questions


```python
import enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel

class QueryType(str, enum.Enum):
    """Enumeration representing the types of queries that can be asked to a question answer system."""

    SINGLE_QUESTION = "SINGLE"
    MERGE_MULTIPLE_RESPONSES = "MERGE_MULTIPLE_RESPONSES"

class Query(BaseModel):
    """Class representing a single question in a query plan."""

    id: int = Field(..., description="Unique id of the query")
    question: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Question asked using a question answering system",
    )
    dependencies: List[int] = Field(
        default_factory=list,
        description="List of sub questions that need to be answered before asking this question",
    )
    node_type: QueryType = Field(
        default=QueryType.SINGLE_QUESTION,
        description="Type of question, either a single question or a multi-question merge",
    )

class QueryPlan(BaseModel):
    """Container class representing a tree of questions to ask a question answering system."""

    query_graph: List[Query] = Field(
        ..., description="The query graph representing the plan"
    )

    def _dependencies(self, ids: List[int]) -> List[Query]:
        """Returns the dependencies of a query given their ids."""
        
        return [q for q in self.query_graph if q.id in ids]
```

Also, a `tool_schema` needs to be defined. It is an instance of `QueryPlan` and is used to initialize the agent.

```python
tool_schema = QueryPlan(
    query_graph = [query.dict() for query in [
        Query(
            id=1,
            question="How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?",
            dependencies=[2],
            node_type=QueryType('SINGLE')
        ),
        # ... other queries ...
    ]]
)
```

#### Step 2. Defining the Planning Agent

We specify the query, task specification and an appropriate system prompt.

```python
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
from swarms import Agent

query = "How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?"
task = f"Consider: {query}. Generate just the correct query plan in JSON format."
system_prompt = (
        "You are a world class query planning algorithm " 
        "capable of breaking apart questions into its " 
        "dependency queries such that the answers can be " 
        "used to inform the parent question. Do not answer " 
        "the questions, simply provide a correct compute " 
        "graph with good specific questions to ask and relevant " 
        "dependencies. Before you call the function, think " 
        "step-by-step to get a better understanding of the problem."
    )
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.0, model_name="gpt-4", max_tokens=4000
)
```

Then, we proceed with agent definition.

```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Query Planner",
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    # Set the tool schema to the JSON string -- this is the key difference
    tool_schema=tool_schema,
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    interactive=False,
    # Set the output type to the tool schema which is a BaseModel
    output_type=tool_schema, # or dict, or str
    metadata_output_type="json",
    # List of schemas that the agent can handle
    list_base_models=[tool_schema],
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json", # or soon yaml
)
```

#### Step 3. Obtaining Outline from Planning Agent 

We now run the agent, and since its output is in JSON format, we can load it as a dictionary.

```python
generated_data = agent.run(task)
```

At times the agent could return extra content other than JSON. Below function will filter it out.

```python
def process_json_output(content):
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of '```json\n'
    start_index = content.find('```json\n')
    if start_index == -1:
        # If '```json\n' is not found, return the original content
        return content
    # Return the part of the content after '```json\n' and remove the '```' at the end
    return content[start_index + len('```json\n'):].rstrip('`')

# Use the function to clean up the output
json_content = process_json_output(generated_data.content)

import json

# Load the JSON string into a Python object
json_object = json.loads(json_content)

# Convert the Python object back to a JSON string
json_content = json.dumps(json_object, indent=2)

# Print the JSON string
print(json_content)
```

Below is the output this produces

```json
{
  "main_query": "How do we improve Nike's revenue in Q3 2024?",
  "sub_queries": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "query": "What is Nike's current revenue trend?"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "query": "What are the projected market trends for the sports apparel industry in 2024?"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "query": "What are the current successful strategies being used by Nike's competitors?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "query": "What are the current and projected economic conditions in Nike's major markets?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "5",
      "query": "What are the current consumer preferences in the sports apparel industry?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "6",
      "query": "What are the potential areas of improvement in Nike's current business model?",
      "dependencies": [
        "1"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "7",
      "query": "What are the potential new markets for Nike to explore in 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "2",
        "4"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "query": "What are the potential new products or services Nike could introduce in 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "5"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "9",
      "query": "What are the potential marketing strategies Nike could use to increase its revenue in Q3 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "3",
        "5",
        "7",
        "8"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "10",
      "query": "What are the potential cost-saving strategies Nike could implement to increase its net revenue in Q3 2024?",
      "dependencies": [
        "6"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The JSON dictionary is not convenient for humans to process. We make a directed graph out of it.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import textwrap
import random

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Define a color map
color_map = {}

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
for sub_query in json_object['sub_queries']:
    # Check if 'dependencies' key exists in sub_query, if not, initialize it as an empty list
    if 'dependencies' not in sub_query:
        sub_query['dependencies'] = []
    # Assign a random color for each node
    color_map[sub_query['id']] = "#{:06x}".format(random.randint(0, 0xFFFFFF))
    G.add_node(sub_query['id'], label=textwrap.fill(sub_query['query'], width=20))
    for dependency in sub_query['dependencies']:
        G.add_edge(dependency, sub_query['id'])

# Draw the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=800, node_color=[color_map[node] for node in G.nodes()], node_shape="o", alpha=0.5, linewidths=40)

# Prepare labels for legend
labels = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'label')
handles = [plt.Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color=color_map[node], label=f"{node}: {label}", markersize=10, linestyle='None') for node, label in labels.items()]

# Create a legend
plt.legend(handles=handles, title="Queries", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')

plt.show()
```

This produces the below diagram which makes the plan much more convenient to understand.

### Doing Background Research and Gathering Data

At this point, we have solved the first half of the problem. We have an outline consisting of sub-problems to to tackled to solve our business problem. This will form the overall structure of our report. We now need to research information for each sub-problem in order to write an informed report. This mechanically intensive and is the aspect that will most benefit from Agentic intervention. 

Essentially, we can spawn parallel agents to gather the data. Each agent will have 2 tools:

- Internet access
- Financial data retrieval

As they run parallelly, they will add their knowledge into a common long-term memory. We will then spawn a separate report writing agent with access to this memory to generate our business case report.

#### Step 4. Defining Tools for Worker Agents

Let us first define the 2 tools. 

```python
import os
from typing import List, Dict

from swarms import tool

os.environ['TAVILY_API_KEY'] = os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY')
os.environ["KAY_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('KAY_API_KEY')

from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field

from kay.rag.retrievers import KayRetriever

def browser(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Search the query in the browser with the Tavily API tool.
    Args:
        query (str): The query to search in the browser.
    Returns:
        str: The search results
    """
    internet_search = TavilySearchResults()
    results =  internet_search.invoke({"query": query})
    response = '' 
    for result in results:
        response += (result['content'] + '\n')
    return response

def kay_retriever(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Search the financial data query with the KayAI API tool.
    Args:
        query (str): The query to search in the KayRetriever.
    Returns:
        str: The first context retrieved as a string.
    """
    # Initialize the retriever
    retriever = KayRetriever(dataset_id = "company",  data_types=["10-K", "10-Q", "8-K", "PressRelease"])
    # Query the retriever
    context = retriever.query(query=query,num_context=1)
    return context[0]['chunk_embed_text']
```

#### Step 5. Defining Long-Term Memory

As mentioned previously, the worker agents running parallelly, will pool their knowledge into a common memory. Let us define that.

```python
import logging
import os
import uuid
from typing import Callable, List, Optional

import chromadb
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from swarms.utils.data_to_text import data_to_text
from swarms.utils.markdown_message import display_markdown_message
from swarms_memory import  AbstractVectorDatabase


# Results storage using local ChromaDB
class ChromaDB(AbstractVectorDatabase):
    """

    ChromaDB database

    Args:
        metric (str): The similarity metric to use.
        output (str): The name of the collection to store the results in.
        limit_tokens (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens to use for the query. Defaults to 1000.
        n_results (int, optional): The number of results to retrieve. Defaults to 2.

    Methods:
        add: _description_
        query: _description_

    Examples:
        >>> chromadb = ChromaDB(
        >>>     metric="cosine",
        >>>     output="results",
        >>>     llm="gpt3",
        >>>     openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
        >>> )
        >>> chromadb.add(task, result, result_id)
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        metric: str = "cosine",
        output_dir: str = "swarms",
        limit_tokens: Optional[int] = 1000,
        n_results: int = 3,
        embedding_function: Callable = None,
        docs_folder: str = None,
        verbose: bool = False,
        *args,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        self.metric = metric
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        self.limit_tokens = limit_tokens
        self.n_results = n_results
        self.docs_folder = docs_folder
        self.verbose = verbose

        # Disable ChromaDB logging
        if verbose:
            logging.getLogger("chromadb").setLevel(logging.INFO)

        # Create Chroma collection
        chroma_persist_dir = "chroma"
        chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(
            settings=chromadb.config.Settings(

            display_markdown_message(
                f"Traversing directory: {docs_folder}"
            )
            self.traverse_directory()

    def add(

                print(f"{file} added to Database")

        return added_to_db
```

We can now proceed to initialize the memory.

```python
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions
default_ef = embedding_functions.DefaultEmbeddingFunction()

memory = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    n_results=3,
    output_dir="results",
    embedding_function=default_ef
)
```

#### Step 6. Defining Worker Agents 

The Worker Agent sub-classes the `Agent` class. The only different between these 2 is in how the `run()` method works. In the `Agent` class, `run()` simply returns the set of tool commands to run, but does not execute it. We, however, desire this. In addition, after we run our tools, we get the relevant information as output. We want to add this information to our memory. Hence, to incorporate these 2 changes, we define `WorkerAgent` as follows.

```python
class WorkerAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)
        print(response.content)

        json_dict = json.loads(process_json_output(response.content))

        #print(json.dumps(json_dict, indent=2))
        
        if response!=None:
            try:
                commands = json_dict["commands"]
            except:
                commands = [json_dict['command']]
                
            for command in commands:
                tool_name = command["name"]

                if tool_name not in ['browser', 'kay_retriever']:
                    continue
                
                query = command["args"]["query"]

                # Get the tool by its name
                tool = globals()[tool_name]
                tool_response = tool(query)

                # Add tool's output to long term memory
                self.long_term_memory.add(tool_response)
```

We can then instantiate an object of the `WorkerAgent` class.

```python
worker_agent = WorkerAgent(
    agent_name="Worker Agent",

#### Step 7. Running the Worker Agents

At this point, we need to setup a concurrent workflow. While the order of adding tasks to the workflow doesn't matter (since they will all run concurrently late when executed), we can take some time to define an order for these tasks. This order will come in handy later when writing the report using our Writer Agent. 

The order we will follow is Breadth First Traversal (BFT) of the sub-queries in the graph we had made earlier (shown below again for reference). BFT makes sense to be used here because we want all the dependent parent questions to be answered before answering the child question. Also, since we could have independent subgraphs, we will also perform BFT separately on each subgraph.

![Query Plan Mini](../assets/img/docs/query-plan-mini.png)

Below is the code that produces the order of processing sub-queries.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Define the graph nodes
nodes = json_object['sub_queries']

# Create a graph from the nodes
graph = defaultdict(list)
for node in nodes:
    for dependency in node['dependencies']:
        graph[dependency].append(node['id'])

# Find all nodes with no dependencies (potential starting points)
start_nodes = [node['id'] for node in nodes if not node['dependencies']]

# Adjust the BFT function to handle dependencies correctly
def bft_corrected(start, graph, nodes_info):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    order = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            # Check if all dependencies of the current node are visited
            node_dependencies = [n['id'] for n in nodes if n['id'] == node][0]
            dependencies_met = all(dep in visited for dep in nodes_info[node_dependencies]['dependencies'])
            
            if dependencies_met:
                visited.add(node)
                order.append(node)
                # Add only nodes to the queue whose dependencies are fully met
                for next_node in graph[node]:
                    if all(dep in visited for dep in nodes_info[next_node]['dependencies']):
                        queue.append(next_node)
            else:
                # Requeue the node to check dependencies later
                queue.append(node)
    
    return order

# Dictionary to access node information quickly
nodes_info = {node['id']: node for node in nodes}

# Perform BFT for each unvisited start node using the corrected BFS function
visited_global = set()
bfs_order = []

for start in start_nodes:
    if start not in visited_global:
        order = bft_corrected(start, graph, nodes_info)
        bfs_order.extend(order)
        visited_global.update(order)

print("BFT Order:", bfs_order)
```

This produces the following output.

```python
BFT Order: ['1', '6', '10', '2', '3', '4', '5', '7', '8', '9']
```

Now, let's define our `ConcurrentWorkflow` and run it.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow, OpenAIChat, Task

# Create a workflow
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(max_workers=5)
task_list = []

for node in bfs_order:
    sub_query =nodes_info[node]['query']
    task = Task(worker_agent, sub_query)
    print('-----------------')
    print("Added task: ", sub_query)
    print('-----------------')
    task_list.append(task)

workflow.add(tasks=task_list)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()
```

Below is part of the output this workflow produces. We clearly see the thought process of the agent and the plan it came up to solve a particular sub-query. In addition, we see the tool-calling schema it produces in `"command"`.

```python
...
...
content='\n{\n  "thoughts": {\n    "text": "To find out Nike\'s current revenue trend, I will use the financial data retriever tool to search for \'Nike revenue trend\'.",\n    "reasoning": "The financial data retriever tool allows me to search for specific financial data, so I can look up the current revenue trend of Nike.", \n    "plan": "Use the financial data retriever tool to search for \'Nike revenue trend\'. Parse the result to get the current revenue trend and format that into a readable report."\n  },\n  "command": {\n    "name": "kay_retriever", \n    "args": {\n      "query": "Nike revenue trend"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 152, 'prompt_tokens': 1527, 'total_tokens': 1679}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}
Saved agent state to: Worker Agent_state.json

{
  "thoughts": {
    "text": "To find out Nike's current revenue trend, I will use the financial data retriever tool to search for 'Nike revenue trend'.",
    "reasoning": "The financial data retriever tool allows me to search for specific financial data, so I can look up the current revenue trend of Nike.", 
    "plan": "Use the financial data retriever tool to search for 'Nike revenue trend'. Parse the result to get the current revenue trend and format that into a readable report."
  },
  "command": {
    "name": "kay_retriever", 
    "args": {
      "query": "Nike revenue trend"
    }
  }
}

-----------------
Document added successfully
-----------------
...
...
```

Here, `"name"` pertains to the name of the tool to be called and `"args"` is the arguments to be passed to the tool call. Like mentioned before, we modify `Agent`'s default behaviour in `WorkerAgent`. Hence, the tool call is executed here and its results (information from web pages and Kay Retriever API) are added to long-term memory. We get confirmation for this from the message `Document added successfully`. 


#### Step 7. Generating the report using Writer Agent

At this point, our Worker Agents have gathered all the background information required to generate the report. We have also defined a coherent structure to write the report, which is following the BFT order to answering the sub-queries. Now it's time to define a Writer Agent and call it sequentially in the order of sub-queries. 

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, tool

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer Agent",
    agent_description=(
        "This agent writes reports based on information in long-term memory"
    ),
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a world-class financial report writer. " 
        "Write analytical and accurate responses using memory to answer the query. "
        "Do not mention use of long-term memory in the report. "
        "Do not mention Writer Agent in response."
        "Return only response content in strict markdown format."
    ),
    llm=OpenAIChat(temperature=0.2, model='gpt-3.5-turbo'),
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    verbose=True,
    long_term_memory=memory,
)
```

The report individual sections of the report will be collected in a list.

```python
report = []
```

Let us now run the writer agent.

```python
for node in bfs_order:
    sub_query =nodes_info[node]['query']
    print("Running task: ", sub_query)
    out = agent.run(f"Consider: {sub_query}. Write response in strict markdown format using long-term memory. Do not mention Writer Agent in response.")
    print(out)
    try:
        report.append(out.content)
    except:
        pass
```

Now, we need to clean up the repoort a bit to make it render professionally. 

```python
# Remove any content before the first "#" as that signals start of heading
# Anything before this usually contains filler content
stripped_report = [entry[entry.find('#'):] if '#' in entry else entry for entry in report]
report = stripped_report

# At times the LLM outputs \\n instead of \n
cleaned_report = [entry.replace("\\n", "\n") for entry in report]
import re

# Function to clean up unnecessary metadata from the report entries
def clean_report(report):
    cleaned_report = []
    for entry in report:
        # This pattern matches 'response_metadata={' followed by any characters that are not '}' (non-greedy), 
        # possibly nested inside other braces, until the closing '}'.
        cleaned_entry = re.sub(r"response_metadata=\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}", "", entry, flags=re.DOTALL)
        cleaned_report.append(cleaned_entry)
    return cleaned_report

# Apply the cleaning function to the markdown report
cleaned_report = clean_report(cleaned_report)
```

After cleaning, we append parts of the report together to get out final report.

```python
final_report = ' \n '.join(cleaned_report)
```

In Jupyter Notebook, we can use the below code to render it in Markdown. 

```python
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

display(Markdown(final_report))
```

# Limitations of Individual Agents

This section explores the fundamental limitations of individual AI agents and why multi-agent systems are necessary for complex tasks. Understanding these limitations is crucial for designing effective multi-agent architectures.

## Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Individual Agent Limitations] --> B[Context Window Limits]
    A --> C[Hallucination]
    A --> D[Single Task Execution]
    A --> E[Lack of Collaboration]
    A --> F[Accuracy Issues]
    A --> G[Processing Speed]
```

## :material-package-variant: Dependency Management

Choose your preferred method for managing dependencies:

=== "Poetry (Recommended)"
    
    Poetry provides superior dependency resolution and virtual environment management.

    ### Installation
    
    ```bash
    # Navigate to project directory
    cd swarms
    
    # Install all dependencies including development tools
    poetry install --with dev,lint,test
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    poetry shell
    ```

    ### Useful Poetry Commands
    
    ```bash
    # Add a new dependency
    poetry add package_name
    
    # Add a development dependency
    poetry add --group dev package_name
    
    # Update dependencies
    poetry update
    
    # Show dependency tree
    poetry show --tree
    
    # Run commands in the virtual environment
    poetry run python your_script.py
    ```

=== "pip + venv"
    
    Traditional pip-based setup with virtual environments.

    ### Installation
    
    ```bash
    # Navigate to project directory
    cd swarms
    
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate virtual environment
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
    
    # Install core dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Install documentation dependencies (optional)
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

---

## :material-tools: Development Tools Setup

### Code Quality Tools

Swarms uses several tools to maintain code quality:

=== "Formatting"
    
    **Black** - Code formatter
    ```bash
    # Format code
    poetry run black swarms/
    # or with pip:
    black swarms/
    
    # Check formatting without making changes
    black swarms/ --check --diff
    ```

=== "Linting"
    
    **Ruff** - Fast Python linter
    ```bash
    # Run linter
    poetry run ruff check swarms/
    # or with pip:
    ruff check swarms/
    
    # Auto-fix issues
    ruff check swarms/ --fix
    ```

=== "Type Checking"
    
    **MyPy** - Static type checker
    ```bash
    # Run type checking
    poetry run mypy swarms/
    # or with pip:
    mypy swarms/
    ```

### Pre-commit Hooks (Optional but Recommended)

Set up pre-commit hooks to automatically run quality checks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
poetry add --group dev pre-commit
# or with pip:
pip install pre-commit

# Install git hooks
pre-commit install

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The project uses the latest ruff-pre-commit configuration with separate hooks for linting and formatting:

- **ruff-check**: Runs the linter with automatic fixes (`--fix` flag)
- **ruff-format**: Runs the formatter for code styling
- **types_or: [python, pyi]**: Excludes Jupyter notebooks from processing

This configuration ensures consistent code quality and style across the project while avoiding conflicts with Jupyter notebook files.

## :material-test-tube: Testing Setup

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest
# or with pip:
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=swarms tests/

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_specific_file.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
poetry run pytest -k "test_agent"
```

### Test Structure

The project uses pytest with the following structure:
```
tests/
├── agents/          # Agent-related tests
├── structs/         # Multi-agent structure tests
├── tools/           # Tool tests

from swarms import Agent

def test_agent_creation():
    """Test that an agent can be created successfully."""
    agent = Agent(
        agent_name="test_agent",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
    )
    assert agent.agent_name == "test_agent"

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_val,expected", [
    ("hello", "HELLO"),
    ("world", "WORLD"),
])
def test_uppercase(input_val, expected):
    """Example parametrized test."""
    assert input_val.upper() == expected
```

For manual setups, verify your setup is working correctly:

### 1. Basic Import Test
```bash
poetry run python -c "from swarms import Agent; print('✅ Import successful')"
```

### 2. Run a Simple Agent
```python
# test_setup.py
from swarms import Agent

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="setup_test",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant for testing setup.",
    max_loops=1
)

response = agent.run("Say hello!")
print(f"✅ Agent response: {response}")
```

### 3. Code Quality Check
```bash
# Run all quality checks
poetry run black swarms/ --check
poetry run ruff check swarms/
poetry run pytest tests/ -x
```

# Contributing Tools and Plugins to the Swarms Ecosystem

## Introduction

The Swarms ecosystem is a modular, intelligent framework built to support the seamless integration, execution, and orchestration of dynamic tools that perform specific functions. These tools form the foundation for how autonomous agents operate, enabling them to retrieve data, communicate with APIs, conduct computational tasks, and respond intelligently to real-world requests. By contributing to Swarms Tools, developers can empower agents with capabilities that drive practical, enterprise-ready applications.

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for contributing tools and plugins to the [Swarms Tools repository](https://github.com/The-Swarm-Corporation/swarms-tools). It is written for software engineers, data scientists, platform architects, and technologists who seek to develop modular, production-grade functionality within the Swarms agent framework.

Whether your expertise lies in finance, security, machine learning, or developer tooling, this documentation outlines the essential standards, workflows, and integration patterns to make your contributions impactful and interoperable.

## Repository Architecture

The Swarms Tools GitHub repository is meticulously organized to maintain structure, scalability, and domain-specific clarity. Each folder within the repository represents a vertical where tools can be contributed and extended over time. These folders include:

- `finance/`: Market analytics, stock price retrievers, blockchain APIs, etc.

- `social/`: Sentiment analysis, engagement tracking, and media scraping utilities.

- `health/`: Interfaces for EHR systems, wearable device APIs, or health informatics.

- `ai/`: Model-serving utilities, embedding services, and prompt engineering functions.

- `security/`: Encryption libraries, risk scoring tools, penetration test interfaces.

- `devtools/`: Build tools, deployment utilities, code quality analyzers.

- `misc/`: General-purpose helpers or utilities that serve multiple domains.

Each tool inside these directories is implemented as a single, self-contained function. These functions are expected to adhere to Swarms-wide standards for clarity, typing, documentation, and API key handling.

## Tool Development Specifications

To ensure long-term maintainability and smooth agent-tool integration, each contribution must strictly follow the specifications below.

### 1. Function Structure and API Usage

```python
import requests
import os

def fetch_data(symbol: str, date_range: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetch financial data for a given symbol and date range.

    Args:
        symbol (str): Ticker symbol of the asset.
        date_range (str): Timeframe for the data (e.g., '1d', '1m', '1y').

    Returns:
        str: A string containing financial data or an error message.
    """
    api_key = os.getenv("FINANCE_API_KEY")
    url = f"https://api.financeprovider.com/data?symbol={symbol}&range={date_range}&apikey={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    return "Error fetching data."
```

All logic must be encapsulated inside a single callable function, written using pure Python. Where feasible, network requests should be stateless, side-effect-free, and gracefully handle errors or timeouts.

### 2. Type Hints and Input Validation

All function parameters must be typed using Python's type hinting system. Use built-in primitives where possible (e.g., `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`) and make use of `Optional` or `Union` types when dealing with nullable parameters or multiple formats. This aids LLMs and type checkers in understanding expected input ranges.

### 3. Standardized Output Format

Regardless of internal logic or complexity, tools must return outputs in a consistent string format. This string can contain plain text or a serialized JSON object (as a string), but must not return raw objects, dictionaries, or binary blobs. This standardization ensures all downstream agents can interpret tool output predictably.

### 4. API Key Management Best Practices

Security and environment isolation are paramount. Never hardcode API keys or sensitive credentials inside source code. Always retrieve them dynamically using the `os.getenv("ENV_VAR")` approach. If a tool requires credentials, clearly document the required environment variable names in the function docstring.

### 5. Documentation Guidelines

Every tool must include a detailed docstring that describes:

- The function's purpose and operational scope

- All parameter types and formats

- A clear return type

- Usage examples or sample inputs/outputs

Example usage:
```python
result = fetch_data("AAPL", "1m")
print(result)
```

Well-documented code accelerates adoption and improves LLM interpretability.

## Contribution Workflow

To submit a tool, follow the workflow below. This ensures your code integrates cleanly and is easy for maintainers to review.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
Navigate to the [Swarms Tools repository](https://github.com/The-Swarm-Corporation/swarms-tools) and fork it to your personal or organization’s GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swarms-tools.git
cd swarms-tools
```

### Step 3: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-tool-<tool-name>
```

Use descriptive branch names. This is especially helpful when collaborating in teams or maintaining audit trails.

### Step 4: Build Your Tool
Navigate into the appropriate category folder (e.g., `finance/`, `ai/`, etc.) and implement your tool according to the defined schema.

If your tool belongs in a new category, you may create a new folder with a clear, lowercase name.

### Step 5: Run Local Tests (if applicable)
Ensure the function executes correctly and does not throw runtime errors. If feasible, test edge cases and verify consistent behavior across platforms.

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add <tool_name> under <folder_name>: API-based tool for X"
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/add-tool-<tool-name>
```

### Step 8: Submit a Pull Request

On GitHub, open a pull request from your fork to the main Swarms Tools repository. Your PR description should:
- Summarize the tool’s functionality
- Reference any related issues or enhancements
- Include usage notes or setup instructions (e.g., required API keys)

---

## Integration with Swarms Agents

Once your tool has been merged into the official repository, it can be utilized by Swarms agents as part of their available capabilities.

The example below illustrates how to embed a newly added tool into an autonomous agent:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from finance.stock_price import get_stock_price

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Devin",
    system_prompt=(
        "Autonomous agent that can interact with humans and other agents."
        " Be helpful and kind. Use the tools provided to assist the user."
        " Return all code in markdown format."
    ),
    llm=llm,
    max_loops="auto",
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    interactive=True,
    tools=[get_stock_price, terminal, browser, file_editor, create_file],
    metadata_output_type="json",
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",
)

agent.run("Create a new file for a plan to take over the world.")
```

By registering tools in the `tools` parameter during agent creation, you enable dynamic function calling. The agent interprets natural language input, selects the appropriate tool, and invokes it with valid arguments.

This agent-tool paradigm enables highly flexible and responsive behavior across workflows involving research, automation, financial analysis, social listening, and more.

---

## Tool Maintenance and Long-Term Ownership

Contributors are expected to uphold the quality of their tools post-merge. This includes:

- Monitoring for issues or bugs reported by the community

- Updating tools when APIs deprecate or modify their behavior

- Improving efficiency, error handling, or documentation over time

If a tool becomes outdated or unsupported, maintainers may archive or revise it to maintain ecosystem integrity.

Contributors whose tools receive wide usage or demonstrate excellence in design may be offered elevated privileges or invited to maintain broader tool categories.

---

## Best Practices for Enterprise-Grade Contributions

To ensure your tool is production-ready and enterprise-compliant, observe the following practices:


- Run static type checking with `mypy`

- Use formatters like `black` and linters such as `flake8`

- Avoid unnecessary external dependencies

- Keep functions modular and readable

- Prefer named parameters over positional arguments for clarity

- Handle API errors gracefully and return user-friendly messages

- Document limitations or assumptions in the docstring

Optional but encouraged:
- Add unit tests to validate function output

- Benchmark performance if your tool operates on large datasets

---

## Conclusion

The Swarms ecosystem is built on the principle of extensibility through community-driven contributions. By submitting modular, typed, and well-documented tools to the Swarms Tools repository, you directly enhance the problem-solving power of intelligent agents.

This documentation serves as your blueprint for contributing high-quality, reusable functionality. From idea to implementation to integration, your efforts help shape the future of collaborative, agent-powered software.

We encourage all developers, data scientists, and domain experts to contribute meaningfully. Review existing tools for inspiration, or create something entirely novel.

# **Swarms Goals & Milestone Tracking: A Vision for 2024 and Beyond**

As we propel Swarms into a new frontier, we’ve set ambitious yet achievable goals for the coming years that will solidify Swarms as a leader in multi-agent 
orchestration. This document outlines our vision, the goals for 2024 and 2025, and how we track our progress through meticulously designed milestones and metrics.

## **Our Vision: The Agentic Ecosystem**

We envision an ecosystem where agents are pervasive and serve as integral collaborators in business processes, daily life, and complex problem-solving. By leveraging 
the collective intelligence of swarms, we believe we can achieve massive gains in productivity, scalability, and impact. Our target is to establish the Swarms platform as the go-to environment for deploying and managing agents at an unprecedented scale—making agents as common and indispensable as mobile apps are today. This future 
will see agents integrated into nearly every digital interaction, creating a seamless extension of human capability and reducing the cognitive load on individuals and organizations.

We believe that *agents* will transition from being simple tools to becoming full-fledged partners that can understand user needs, predict outcomes, and adapt to 
changes dynamically. Our vision is not just about increasing numbers; it’s about building a smarter, more interconnected agentic ecosystem where every agent has a purpose and contributes to a collective intelligence that continuously evolves. By cultivating a diverse array of agents capable of handling various specialized tasks, we aim to create an environment in which these digital collaborators function as a cohesive whole—one that can amplify human ingenuity and productivity beyond current limits.

## **Goals for 2024 and 2025**

To achieve our vision, we have laid out a structured growth trajectory for Swarms, driven by clear numerical targets:

1. **End of 2024: 500 Million Agents**  
   Currently, our platform hosts **45 million agents**. By the end of 2024, our goal is to reach **500 million agents** deployed on Swarms. This means achieving sustained exponential growth, which will require doubling or even tripling the total number of agents roughly **every month** from now until December 2024. Such growth will necessitate not only scaling infrastructure but also improving the ease with which users can develop and deploy agents, expanding educational resources, and fostering a vibrant community that drives innovation in agent design. To achieve this milestone, we plan to invest heavily in making our platform user-friendly, including simplifying onboarding processes and providing extensive educational content. Additionally, we aim to build out our infrastructure to support the necessary scalability and ensure the seamless operation of a growing number of agents. Beyond merely scaling in numbers, we are also focused on increasing the diversity of tasks that agents can perform, thereby enhancing the practical value of deploying agents on Swarms.

2. **End of 2025: 10 Billion+ Agents**  
   The long-term vision extends further to reach **10 billion agents** by the end of 2025. This ambitious goal reflects not only the organic growth of our user base but 
   also the increasing role of swarms in business applications, personal projects, and global problem-solving initiatives. This goal requires continuous monthly 
   doubling of agents and a clear roadmap of user engagement and deployment. By scaling to this level, we envision Swarms as a cornerstone of automation and productivity enhancement, where agents autonomously manage everything from mundane tasks to sophisticated strategic decisions, effectively enhancing human capabilities. This expansion will rely on the development of a robust ecosystem in which users can easily create, share, and enhance agents. We will foster partnerships with industries that can benefit from scalable agentic solutions—spanning healthcare, finance, education, and beyond. Our strategy includes developing domain-specific templates and specialized agents that cater to niche needs, thereby making Swarms an indispensable solution for businesses and individuals alike.

## **Tracking Progress: The Power of Metrics**

Achieving these goals is not just about reaching numerical targets but ensuring that our users are deriving tangible value from Swarms and deploying agents effectively. To measure success, we’ve defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) and milestones:

### 1. Growth in Agent Deployment

The **number of agents** deployed per month will be our primary growth metric. With our goal of **doubling agent count every month**, this metric serves as an overall health indicator for platform adoption and usage. Growth in deployment indicates that our platform is attracting users who see value in creating and deploying agents to solve diverse challenges.

**Key Milestones:**

- **November 2024**: Surpass 250 million agents.  

- **December 2024**: Reach 500 million agents.  

- **June 2025**: Break the 5 billion agents mark.  

- **December 2025**: Hit 10 billion agents.  


To accomplish this, we must continually expand our infrastructure, maintain scalability, and create a seamless user onboarding process. We’ll ensure that adding agents is frictionless and that our platform can accommodate this rapid growth. By integrating advanced orchestration capabilities, we will enable agents to form more complex collaborations and achieve tasks that previously seemed out of reach. Furthermore, we will develop analytics tools to track the success and efficiency of these agents, giving users real-time feedback to optimize their deployment strategies.


### 2. Agents Deployed Per User: Engagement Indicator

A core belief of Swarms is that agents are here to make life easier for their users—whether it’s automating mundane tasks, handling complex workflows, or enhancing creative endeavors. Therefore, we measure the **number of agents deployed per user per month** as a key metric for engagement. Tracking this metric allows us to understand how effectively our users are utilizing the platform, and how deeply agents are becoming embedded into their workflows.

This metric ensures that users aren’t just joining Swarms, but they are actively building and deploying agents to solve real problems. Our milestone for engagement is to see **increasing growth in agents deployed per user** month over month, which indicates a deeper integration of Swarms into daily workflows and business processes. We want our users to view Swarms as their go-to solution for any problem they face, which means ensuring that agents are providing real, tangible benefits.


**Key Milestones:**

- **November 2024**: Achieve an average of 20 agents deployed per user each month. 

- **June 2025**: Target 100-200+ agents deployed per user.  


To drive these numbers, we plan to improve user support, enhance educational materials, host workshops, and create an environment that empowers users to deploy agents for increasingly complex use-cases. Additionally, we will introduce templates and pre-built agents that users can customize, reducing the barriers to entry and enabling 
rapid deployment for new users. We are also developing gamified elements that reward users for deploying more agents and achieving milestones, fostering a competitive and engaging community atmosphere.

### 3. Active vs. Inactive Agents: Measuring Churn

The **number of inactive agents per user** is an essential metric for understanding our **churn rate**. An agent is considered inactive when it remains undeployed or unused for a prolonged period, indicating that it’s no longer delivering value to the user. Churn metrics provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of our agents and highlight areas where improvements are needed.

We aim to **minimize the number of inactive agents**, as this will be a direct reflection of how well our agents are designed, integrated, and supported. A low churn rate means that users are finding long-term utility in their agents, which is key to our mission. Our platform’s success depends on users consistently deploying agents 
that remain active and valuable over time.

**Key Milestones:**

- **December 2024**: Ensure that no more than **30%** of deployed agents are inactive.  

- **December 2025**: Aim for **10%** or lower, reflecting strong agent usefulness and consistent platform value delivery.  


Reducing churn will require proactive measures, such as automated notifications to users about inactive agents, recommending potential uses, and implementing agent retraining features to enhance their adaptability over time. Educating users on prompting engineering, tool engineering, and RAG engineering also helps decrease these numbers as the number of inactive agents is evident that the user is not automating a business operation with that agent. We will also integrate machine learning models to predict agent inactivity and take corrective actions before agents become dormant. By offering personalized recommendations to users on how to enhance or repurpose inactive agents, we hope to ensure that all deployed agents are actively contributing value.

## **Milestones and Success Criteria**

To reach these ambitious goals, we have broken our roadmap down into a series of actionable milestones:

1. **Infrastructure Scalability (Q1 2025)**  
   We will work on ensuring that our backend infrastructure can handle the scale required to reach 500 million agents by the end of 2024. This includes expanding server capacity, improving agent orchestration capabilities, and ensuring low latency across deployments. We will also focus on enhancing our database management systems to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of agent data, enabling seamless operation at a massive scale. Our infrastructure roadmap also includes implementing advanced load balancing techniques and predictive scaling mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability.

2. **Improved User Experience (Q2 2025)**  
   To encourage agent deployment and reduce churn, we will introduce new onboarding flows, agent-building wizards, and intuitive user interfaces. We will also implement 
   in-depth tutorials and documentation to simplify agent creation for new users. By making agent-building accessible even to those without programming expertise, we 
   will open the doors to a broader audience and drive exponential growth in the number of agents deployed. Additionally, we will integrate AI-driven suggestions and 
   contextual help to assist users at every step of the process, making the platform as intuitive as possible.

3. **Agent Marketplace (Q3 2025)**  
   Launching the **Swarms Marketplace** for agents, prompts, and tools will allow users to share, discover, and even monetize their agents. This marketplace will be a crucial driver in both increasing the number of agents deployed and reducing inactive agents, as it will create an ecosystem of continuously evolving and highly useful agents. Users will have the opportunity to browse agents that others have developed, which can serve as inspiration or as a starting point for their own projects. We will also introduce ratings, reviews, and community feedback mechanisms to ensure that the most effective agents are highlighted and accessible.

4. **Community Engagement and Swarms Education (Ongoing)**  
   Workshops, webinars, and events will be conducted throughout 2024 and 2025 to engage new users and educate them on building effective agents. The goal is to ensure that every user becomes proficient in deploying swarms of agents for meaningful tasks. We will foster an active community where users can exchange ideas, get help, and collaborate on projects, ultimately driving forward the growth of the Swarms ecosystem. We also plan to establish a mentor program where experienced users can guide newcomers, helping them get up to speed more quickly and successfully deploy agents.

## **Actionable Strategies for Goal Achievement**

**1. Developer Incentives**  
One of our most important strategies will be the introduction of developer incentives. By providing rewards for creating agents, we foster an environment of creativity and encourage rapid growth in the number of useful agents on the platform. We will host hackathons, contests, and provide financial incentives to developers whose agents provide substantial value to the community. Additionally, we plan to create a tiered rewards system that acknowledges developers for the number of active deployments and the utility of their agents, motivating continuous improvement and innovation.

**2. Strategic Partnerships**  
We plan to form partnerships with major technology providers and industry players to scale Swarms adoption. Integrating Swarms into existing business software and industrial processes will drive significant growth in agent numbers and usage. These partnerships will allow Swarms to become embedded into existing workflows, making it easier for users to understand the value and immediately apply agents to solve real-world challenges. We are also targeting partnerships with educational 
institutions to provide Swarms as a learning platform for AI, encouraging students and researchers to contribute to our growing ecosystem.

**3. User Feedback Loop**  
To ensure we are on track, a continuous feedback loop with our user community will help us understand what agents are effective, which require improvements, and where we need to invest our resources to maximize engagement. Users’ experiences will shape our platform evolution. We will implement regular surveys, feedback forms, and user interviews to gather insights, and use this data to drive iterative development that is directly aligned with user needs.

# Demo Ideas

* We could also try to create an AI influencer run by a swarm, let it create a whole identity and generate images, memes, and other content for Twitter, Reddit, etc.

* had a thought that we should have either a more general one of these or a swarm or both -- need something connecting all the calendars, events, and initiatives of all the AI communities, langchain, laion, eluther, lesswrong, gato, rob miles, chatgpt hackers, etc etc

* Swarm of AI influencers to spread marketing

* Delegation System to better organize teams: Start with a team of passionate humans and let them self-report their skills/strengths so the agent has a concept of who to delegate to, then feed the agent a huge task list (like the bullet list a few messages above) that it breaks down into actionable steps and "prompts" specific team members to complete tasks. Could even suggest breakout teams of a few people with complementary skills to tackle more complex tasks. There can also be a live board that updates each time a team member completes something, to encourage momentum and keep track of progress

## Overview

The goal of the Swarm Architecture is to provide a flexible and scalable system to build swarm intelligence models that can solve complex problems. This document details the proposed design to create a plug-and-play system, which makes it easy to create custom swarms, and provides pre-configured swarms with multi-modal agents.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: The system will be built in a modular fashion, allowing various components to be easily swapped or upgraded.
- **Interoperability**: Different swarm classes and components should be able to work together seamlessly.
- **Scalability**: The design should support the growth of the system by adding more components or swarms.
- **Ease of Use**: Users should be able to easily create their own swarms or use pre-configured ones with minimal configuration.

## Design Components

### BaseSwarm

The BaseSwarm is an abstract base class which defines the basic structure of a swarm and the methods that need to be implemented. Any new swarm should inherit from this class and implement the required methods.

### Swarm Classes

Various Swarm classes can be implemented inheriting from the BaseSwarm class. Each swarm class should implement the required methods for initializing the components, worker nodes, and boss node, and running the swarm.

Pre-configured swarm classes with multi-modal agents can be provided for ease of use. These classes come with a default configuration of tools and agents, which can be used out of the box.

### Tools and Agents

Tools and agents are the components that provide the actual functionality to the swarms. They can be language models, AI assistants, vector stores, or any other components that can help in problem solving.

To make the system plug-and-play, a standard interface should be defined for these components. Any new tool or agent should implement this interface, so that it can be easily plugged into the system.

## Usage

Users can either use pre-configured swarms or create their own custom swarms.

To use a pre-configured swarm, they can simply instantiate the corresponding swarm class and call the run method with the required objective.

To create a custom swarm, they need to:

1. Define a new swarm class inheriting from BaseSwarm.
2. Implement the required methods for the new swarm class.
3. Instantiate the swarm class and call the run method.

### Example

```python
# Using pre-configured swarm
swarm = PreConfiguredSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_swarms(objective)

# Creating custom swarm
class CustomSwarm(BaseSwarm):
    # Implement required methods

swarm = CustomSwarm(openai_api_key)
swarm.run_swarms(objective)
```

## Conclusion

This Swarm Architecture design provides a scalable and flexible system for building swarm intelligence models. The plug-and-play design allows users to easily use pre-configured swarms or create their own custom swarms.


# Swarming Architectures
Sure, below are five different swarm architectures with their base requirements and an abstract class that processes these components:

1. **Hierarchical Swarm**: This architecture is characterized by a boss/worker relationship. The boss node takes high-level decisions and delegates tasks to the worker nodes. The worker nodes perform tasks and report back to the boss node. 
    - Requirements: Boss node (can be a large language model), worker nodes (can be smaller language models), and a task queue for task management.

2. **Homogeneous Swarm**: In this architecture, all nodes in the swarm are identical and contribute equally to problem-solving. Each node has the same capabilities.
    - Requirements: Homogeneous nodes (can be language models of the same size), communication protocol for nodes to share information.

3. **Heterogeneous Swarm**: This architecture contains different types of nodes, each with its specific capabilities. This diversity can lead to more robust problem-solving.
    - Requirements: Different types of nodes (can be different types and sizes of language models), a communication protocol, and a mechanism to delegate tasks based on node capabilities.

4. **Competitive Swarm**: In this architecture, nodes compete with each other to find the best solution. The system may use a selection process to choose the best solutions.
    - Requirements: Nodes (can be language models), a scoring mechanism to evaluate node performance, a selection mechanism.

5. **Cooperative Swarm**: In this architecture, nodes work together and share information to find solutions. The focus is on cooperation rather than competition.
    - Requirements: Nodes (can be language models), a communication protocol, a consensus mechanism to agree on solutions.


6. **Grid-based Swarm**: This architecture positions agents on a grid, where they can only interact with their neighbors. This is useful for simulations, especially in fields like ecology or epidemiology.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), a grid structure, and a neighborhood definition (i.e., how to identify neighboring agents).

7. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Swarm**: In this architecture, each agent represents a potential solution to an optimization problem. Agents move in the solution space based on their own and their neighbors' past performance. PSO is especially useful for continuous numerical optimization problems.
    - Requirements: Agents (each representing a solution), a definition of the solution space, an evaluation function to rate the solutions, a mechanism to adjust agent positions based on performance.

8. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Swarm**: Inspired by ant behavior, this architecture has agents leave a pheromone trail that other agents follow, reinforcing the best paths. It's useful for problems like the traveling salesperson problem.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), a representation of the problem space, a pheromone updating mechanism.

9. **Genetic Algorithm (GA) Swarm**: In this architecture, agents represent potential solutions to a problem. They can 'breed' to create new solutions and can undergo 'mutations'. GA swarms are good for search and optimization problems.
    - Requirements: Agents (each representing a potential solution), a fitness function to evaluate solutions, a crossover mechanism to breed solutions, and a mutation mechanism.

10. **Stigmergy-based Swarm**: In this architecture, agents communicate indirectly by modifying the environment, and other agents react to such modifications. It's a decentralized method of coordinating tasks.
    - Requirements: Agents (can be language models), an environment that agents can modify, a mechanism for agents to perceive environment changes.

These architectures all have unique features and requirements, but they share the need for agents (often implemented as language models) and a mechanism for agents to communicate or interact, whether it's directly through messages, indirectly through the environment, or implicitly through a shared solution space. Some also require specific data structures, like a grid or problem space, and specific algorithms, like for evaluating solutions or updating agent positions.

6. **Harmful Ecosystem Influence**: Langchain's extreme popularity is influencing the AI ecosystem towards the workflows, potentially harming development and code clarity.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Encourage diverse and balanced adoption of AI tools in the ecosystem.

7. **Suboptimal Performances**: Langchain's performance is sometimes underwhelming, and there are no clear benefits in terms of performance or abstraction.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Enhance the performance optimization of Langchain. Benchmarking against other tools can also provide performance improvement insights.

8. **Rigid General Interface**: Langchain tries to do too many things, resulting in a rigid interface not suitable for practical use, especially in production.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Focus on core features and allow greater flexibility in the interface. Adopting a modular approach where developers can pick and choose the features they want could also be helpful.

9. **Leaky Abstraction Problem**: Langchain’s full-on framework approach has created a leaky abstraction problem leading to a disappointing developer experience.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Adopt a more balanced approach between a library and a framework. Provide a solid core feature set with the possibility to extend it according to the developers' needs. 

10. **Excessive Focus on Third-party Services**: Langchain overly focuses on supporting every single third-party service at the expense of customizability and fine-tuning for actual applications.

   *Mitigation Strategy*: Prioritize fine-tuning and customizability for developers, limiting the focus on third-party services unless they provide substantial value.
   
Remember, any mitigation strategy will need to be tailored to Langchain's particular circumstances and developer feedback. It's also important to consider potential trade-offs and unintended consequences when implementing these strategies.

### FAQ on Swarm Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems

#### What is an agent in the context of AI and swarm intelligence?

In artificial intelligence (AI), an agent refers to an LLM with some objective to accomplish.

In swarm intelligence, each agent interacts with other agents and possibly the environment to achieve complex collective behaviors or solve problems more efficiently than individual agents could on their own.


#### What do you need Swarms at all?
Individual agents are limited by a vast array of issues such as context window loss, single task execution, hallucination, and no collaboration.


#### How does a swarm work?

A swarm works through the principles of decentralized control, local interactions, and simple rules followed by each agent. Unlike centralized systems, where a single entity dictates the behavior of all components, in a swarm, each agent makes its own decisions based on local information and interactions with nearby agents. These local interactions lead to the emergence of complex, organized behaviors or solutions at the collective level, enabling the swarm to tackle tasks efficiently.

#### Why do you need more agents in a swarm?

More agents in a swarm can enhance its problem-solving capabilities, resilience, and efficiency. With more agents:

- **Diversity and Specialization**: The swarm can leverage a wider range of skills, knowledge, and perspectives, allowing for more creative and effective solutions to complex problems.
- **Scalability**: Adding more agents can increase the swarm's capacity to handle larger tasks or multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Robustness**: A larger number of agents enhances the system's redundancy and fault tolerance, as the failure of a few agents has a minimal impact on the overall performance of the swarm.

#### Isn't it more expensive to use more agents?

While deploying more agents can initially increase costs, especially in terms of computational resources, hosting, and potentially API usage, there are several factors and strategies that can mitigate these expenses:

- **Efficiency at Scale**: Larger swarms can often solve problems more quickly or effectively, reducing the overall computational time and resources required.
- **Optimization and Caching**: Implementing optimizations and caching strategies can reduce redundant computations, lowering the workload on individual agents and the overall system.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Utilizing cloud services that offer dynamic scaling can ensure you only pay for the resources you need when you need them, optimizing cost-efficiency.

#### Can swarms make decisions better than individual agents?

Yes, swarms can make better decisions than individual agents for several reasons:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Swarms combine the knowledge and insights of multiple agents, leading to more informed and well-rounded decision-making processes.
- **Error Correction**: The collaborative nature of swarms allows for error checking and correction among agents, reducing the likelihood of mistakes.
- **Adaptability**: Swarms are highly adaptable to changing environments or requirements, as the collective can quickly reorganize or shift strategies based on new information.

#### How do agents in a swarm communicate?

Communication in a swarm can vary based on the design and purpose of the system but generally involves either direct or indirect interactions:

- **Direct Communication**: Agents exchange information directly through messaging, signals, or other communication protocols designed for the system.
- **Indirect Communication**: Agents influence each other through the environment, a method known as stigmergy. Actions by one agent alter the environment, which in turn influences the behavior of other agents.

#### Are swarms only useful in computational tasks?

While swarms are often associated with computational tasks, their applications extend far beyond. Swarms can be utilized in:

- **Robotics**: Coordinating multiple robots for tasks like search and rescue, exploration, or surveillance.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Using sensor networks to monitor pollution, wildlife, or climate conditions.
- **Social Sciences**: Modeling social behaviors or economic systems to understand complex societal dynamics.
- **Healthcare**: Coordinating care strategies in hospital settings or managing pandemic responses through distributed data analysis.

#### How do you ensure the security of a swarm system?

Security in swarm systems involves:

- **Encryption**: Ensuring all communications between agents are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
- **Authentication**: Implementing strict authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of each agent in the swarm.
- **Resilience to Attacks**: Designing the swarm to continue functioning effectively even if some agents are compromised or attacked, utilizing redundancy and fault tolerance strategies.

#### How do individual agents within a swarm share insights without direct learning mechanisms like reinforcement learning?

In the context of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) that operate within a swarm, sharing insights typically involves explicit communication and data exchange protocols rather than direct learning mechanisms like reinforcement learning. Here's how it can work:

- **Shared Databases and Knowledge Bases**: Agents can write to and read from a shared database or knowledge base where insights, generated content, and relevant data are stored. This allows agents to benefit from the collective experience of the swarm by accessing information that other agents have contributed.
  
- **APIs for Information Exchange**: Custom APIs can facilitate the exchange of information between agents. Through these APIs, agents can request specific information or insights from others within the swarm, effectively sharing knowledge without direct learning.

#### How do you balance the autonomy of individual LLMs with the need for coherent collective behavior in a swarm?

Balancing autonomy with collective coherence in a swarm of LLMs involves:

- **Central Coordination Mechanism**: Implementing a lightweight central coordination mechanism that can assign tasks, distribute information, and collect outputs from individual LLMs. This ensures that while each LLM operates autonomously, their actions are aligned with the swarm's overall objectives.

- **Standardized Communication Protocols**: Developing standardized protocols for how LLMs communicate and share information ensures that even though each agent works autonomously, the information exchange remains coherent and aligned with the collective goals.

#### How do LLM swarms adapt to changing environments or tasks without machine learning techniques?

Adaptation in LLM swarms, without relying on machine learning techniques for dynamic learning, can be achieved through:

- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: A central system or distributed algorithm can dynamically allocate tasks to different LLMs based on the changing environment or requirements. This ensures that the most suitable LLMs are addressing tasks for which they are best suited as conditions change.

- **Pre-trained Versatility**: Utilizing a diverse set of pre-trained LLMs with different specialties or training data allows the swarm to select the most appropriate agent for a task as the requirements evolve.

- **In Context Learning**: In context learning is another mechanism that can be employed within LLM swarms to adapt to changing environments or tasks. This approach involves leveraging the collective knowledge and experiences of the swarm to facilitate learning and improve performance. Here's how it can work:


#### Can LLM swarms operate in physical environments, or are they limited to digital spaces?

LLM swarms primarily operate in digital spaces, given their nature as software entities. However, they can interact with physical environments indirectly through interfaces with sensors, actuaries, or other devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, LLMs can process data from physical sensors and control devices based on their outputs, enabling applications like smart home management or autonomous vehicle navigation.

#### Without direct learning from each other, how do agents in a swarm improve over time?

Improvement over time in a swarm of pre-trained LLMs, without direct learning from each other, can be achieved through:

- **Human Feedback**: Incorporating feedback from human operators or users can guide adjustments to the usage patterns or selection criteria of LLMs within the swarm, optimizing performance based on observed outcomes.

- **Periodic Re-training and Updating**: The individual LLMs can be periodically re-trained or updated by their developers based on collective insights and feedback from their deployment within swarms. While this does not involve direct learning from each encounter, it allows the LLMs to improve over time based on aggregated experiences.

These adjustments to the FAQ reflect the specific context of pre-trained LLMs operating within a swarm, focusing on communication, coordination, and adaptation mechanisms that align with their capabilities and constraints.


#### Conclusion

Swarms represent a powerful paradigm in AI, offering innovative solutions to complex, dynamic problems through collective intelligence and decentralized control. While challenges exist, particularly regarding cost and security, strategic design and management can leverage the strengths of swarm intelligence to achieve remarkable efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in a wide range of applications.

# The Golden Metric: 95% User-Task-Completion-Satisfaction Rate

In the world of Swarms, there’s one metric that stands above the rest: the User-Task-Completion-Satisfaction (UTCS) rate. This metric is the heart of our system, the pulse that keeps us moving forward. It’s not just a number; it’s a reflection of our commitment to our users and a measure of our success.

## What is the UTCS Rate?
The UTCS rate is a measure of how reliably and quickly Swarms can satisfy a user demand. It’s calculated by dividing the number of tasks completed to the user’s satisfaction by the total number of tasks. Multiply that by 100, and you’ve got your UTCS rate.

But what does it mean to complete a task to the user’s satisfaction? It means that the task is not only completed, but completed in a way that meets or exceeds the user’s expectations. It’s about quality, speed, and reliability.

## Why is the UTCS Rate Important?
The UTCS rate is a direct reflection of the user experience. A high UTCS rate means that users are getting what they need from Swarms, and they’re getting it quickly and reliably. It means that Swarms is doing its job, and doing it well.

But the UTCS rate is not just about user satisfaction. It’s also a measure of Swarms’ efficiency and effectiveness. A high UTCS rate means that Swarms is able to complete tasks quickly and accurately, with minimal errors or delays. It’s a sign of a well-oiled machine.

## How Do We Achieve a 95% UTCS Rate?
Achieving a 95% UTCS rate is no small feat. It requires a deep understanding of our users and their needs, a robust and reliable system, and a commitment to continuous improvement.

### Here are some strategies we’re implementing to reach our goal:

* Understanding User Needs: We must have agents that gain an understanding of the user's objective and break it up into it's most fundamental building blocks

* Improving System Reliability: We’re working to make Swarms more reliable, reducing errors and improving the accuracy of task completion. This includes improving our algorithms, refining our processes, and investing in quality assurance.

* Optimizing for Speed: We’re optimizing Swarms to complete tasks as quickly as possible, without sacrificing quality. This includes improving our infrastructure, streamlining our workflows, and implementing performance optimizations.

*Iterating and Improving: We’re committed to continuous improvement. We’re constantly monitoring our UTCS rate and other key metrics, and we’re always looking for ways to improve. We’re not afraid to experiment, iterate, and learn from our mistakes.

Achieving a 95% UTCS rate is a challenging goal, but it’s a goal worth striving for. It’s a goal that will drive us to improve, innovate, and deliver the best possible experience for our users. And in the end, that’s what Swarms is all about.

**The Golden Metric Analysis: The Ultimate UTCS Paradigm for Swarms**

### Introduction

In our ongoing journey to perfect Swarms, understanding how our product fares in the eyes of the end-users is paramount. Enter the User-Task-Completion-Satisfaction (UTCS) rate - our primary metric that gauges how reliably and swiftly Swarms can meet user demands. As we steer Swarms towards achieving a UTCS rate of 95%, understanding this metric's core and how to refine it becomes vital.

### Decoding UTCS: An Analytical Overview

The UTCS rate is not merely about task completion; it's about the comprehensive experience. Therefore, its foundations lie in:

1. **Quality**: Ensuring tasks are executed flawlessly.
2. **Speed**: Delivering results in the shortest possible time.
3. **Reliability**: Consistency in quality and speed across all tasks.

We can represent the UTCS rate with the following equation:

```latex
\[ UTCS Rate = \frac{(Completed Tasks \times User Satisfaction)}{(Total Tasks)} \times 100 \]
```

Where:
- Completed Tasks refer to the number of tasks Swarms executes without errors.
- User Satisfaction is the subjective component, gauged through feedback mechanisms. This could be on a scale of 1-10 (or a percentage).
- Total Tasks refer to all tasks processed by Swarms, regardless of the outcome.

### The Golden Metric: Swarm Efficiency Index (SEI)

However, this basic representation doesn't factor in a critical component: system performance. Thus, we introduce the Swarm Efficiency Index (SEI). The SEI encapsulates not just the UTCS rate but also system metrics like memory consumption, number of tasks, and time taken. By blending these elements, we aim to present a comprehensive view of Swarm's prowess.

Here’s the formula:

```latex
\[ SEI = \frac{UTCS Rate}{(Memory Consumption + Time Window + Task Complexity)} \]
```

Where:
- Memory Consumption signifies the system resources used to accomplish tasks.
- Time Window is the timeframe in which the tasks were executed.
- Task Complexity could be a normalized scale that defines how intricate a task is (e.g., 1-5, with 5 being the most complex).

Rationale:
- **Incorporating Memory Consumption**: A system that uses less memory but delivers results is more efficient. By inverting memory consumption in the formula, we emphasize that as memory usage goes down, SEI goes up.
  
- **Considering Time**: Time is of the essence. The faster the results without compromising quality, the better. By adding the Time Window, we emphasize that reduced task execution time increases the SEI.
  
- **Factoring in Task Complexity**: Not all tasks are equal. A system that effortlessly completes intricate tasks is more valuable. By integrating task complexity, we can normalize the SEI according to the task's nature.

### Implementing SEI & Improving UTCS

Using feedback from elder-plinius, we can better understand and improve SEI and UTCS:

1. **Feedback Across Skill Levels**: By gathering feedback from users with different skill levels, we can refine our metrics, ensuring Swarms caters to all.

2. **Simplifying Setup**: Detailed guides can help newcomers swiftly get on board, thus enhancing user satisfaction.

3. **Enhancing Workspace and Agent Management**: A clearer view of the Swarm's internal structure, combined with on-the-go adjustments, can improve both the speed and quality of results.

4. **Introducing System Suggestions**: A proactive Swarms that provides real-time insights and recommendations can drastically enhance user satisfaction, thus pushing up the UTCS rate.

### Conclusion

The UTCS rate is undeniably a pivotal metric for Swarms. However, with the introduction of the Swarm Efficiency Index (SEI), we have an opportunity to encapsulate a broader spectrum of performance indicators, leading to a more holistic understanding of Swarms' efficiency. By consistently optimizing for SEI, we can ensure that Swarms not only meets user expectations but also operates at peak system efficiency.

- Eliminates inconsistencies arising from corrupted or irrelevant data.

### 5. Feedback Loops and Continuous Refinement

#### 5.1. User Feedback Integration

**Recommendation**: Develop an in-built user feedback mechanism.

**Rationale**: 
- Helps validate the perceived vs. actual performance.
- Allows for continuous refining of tracking metrics and methodologies.

#### 5.2. A/B Testing

**Recommendation**: Regularly conduct A/B tests for new tracking methods or adjustments.

**Rationale**: 
- Determines the most effective methods for data collection.
- Validates new tracking techniques against established ones.

### 6. Conclusion

To successfully and reliably track the UTCS rate and SEI at scale, it's essential to combine robust monitoring tools, data processing methodologies, and validation techniques. By doing so, Swarms can ensure that the metrics collected offer a genuine reflection of system performance and user satisfaction. Regular feedback and iterative refinement, rooted in a culture of continuous improvement, will further enhance the accuracy and reliability of these essential metrics.

## Purpose
Artificial Intelligence has grown at an exponential rate over the past decade. Yet, we are far from fully harnessing its potential. Today's AI operates in isolation, each working separately in their corner. But life doesn't work like that. The world doesn't work like that. Success isn't built in silos; it's built in teams.

Imagine a world where AI models work in unison. Where they can collaborate, interact, and pool their collective intelligence to achieve more than any single model could. This is the future we envision. But today, we lack a framework for AI to collaborate effectively, to form a true swarm of intelligent agents.


This is a difficult problem, one that has eluded solution. It requires sophisticated systems that can allow individual models to not just communicate but also understand each other, pool knowledge and resources, and create collective intelligence. This is the next frontier of AI.

But here at Swarms, we have a secret sauce. It's not just a technology or a breakthrough invention. It's a way of thinking - the philosophy of rapid iteration. With each cycle, we make massive progress. We experiment, we learn, and we grow. We have developed a pioneering framework that can enable AI models to work together as a swarm, combining their strengths to create richer, more powerful outputs.

We are uniquely positioned to take on this challenge with 1,500+ devoted researchers in Agora. We have assembled a team of world-class experts, experienced and driven, united by a shared vision. Our commitment to breaking barriers, pushing boundaries, and our belief in the power of collective intelligence makes us the best team to usher in this future to fundamentally advance our species, Humanity.

Our target user segment for the framework is AI engineers looking to deploy agents into high risk environments where reliability is crucial. 

Once PMF has been achieved and the framework has been extensively benchmarked we aim to establish high value contracts with customers in Security, Logistics, Manufacturing, Health and various other untapped industries.

Our growth strategy for the OS framework can be summarized by:

- Educating developers on value of autonomous agent usage.
- Tutorial Walkthrough on various applications like deploying multi-modal agents through cameras or building custom swarms for a specific business operation.
- Demonstrate unmatched reliability by delighting users.
- Staying up to date with trends and integrating the latest models, frameworks, and methodologies.
- Building a loyal and devoted community for long term user retention. [Join here](https://codex.apac.ai)

As we continuously deliver value with the open framework we will strategically position ourselves to acquire leads for high value contracts by demonstrating the power, reliability, and performance of our framework openly.

# Agent with Streaming

The Swarms framework provides powerful real-time streaming capabilities for agents, allowing you to see responses being generated token by token as they're produced by the language model. This creates a more engaging and interactive experience, especially useful for long-form content generation, debugging, or when you want to provide immediate feedback to users.

## Installation

Install the swarms package using pip:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

## Basic Setup

1. First, set up your environment variables:

```python
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

## Step by Step

- Install and put your keys in `.env`

- Turn on streaming in `Agent()` with `streaming_on=True`

- Optional: If you want to pretty print it, you can do `print_on=True`; if not, it will print normally

## Code

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Enable real-time streaming
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="StoryAgent",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    streaming_on=True,  # 🔥 This enables real streaming!
    max_loops=1,
    print_on=True,  # By default, it's False for raw streaming!
)

# This will now stream in real-time with a beautiful UI!
response = agent.run("Tell me a detailed story about humanity colonizing the stars")
print(response)
```

### Understanding Agent Evaluation Mechanisms

Agent evaluation mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring that autonomous agents, particularly in multi-agent systems, perform their tasks effectively and efficiently. This blog delves into the intricacies of agent evaluation, the importance of accuracy tracking, and the methodologies used to measure and visualize agent performance. We'll use Mermaid graphs to provide clear visual representations of these processes.

#### 1. Introduction to Agent Evaluation Mechanisms

Agent evaluation mechanisms refer to the processes and criteria used to assess the performance of agents within a system. These mechanisms are essential for:

- **Ensuring Reliability:** Agents must consistently perform their designated tasks correctly.
- **Improving Performance:** Evaluation helps in identifying areas where agents can improve.
- **Maintaining Accountability:** It provides a way to hold agents accountable for their actions.

### 2. Key Components of Agent Evaluation

To effectively evaluate agents, several components and metrics are considered:

#### a. Performance Metrics

These are quantitative measures used to assess how well an agent is performing. Common performance metrics include:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct actions or decisions made by the agent.
- **Precision and Recall:** Precision measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, while recall measures the number of true positive results divided by the number of positives that should have been retrieved.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Response Time:** How quickly an agent responds to a given task or query.

#### b. Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation criteria define the standards or benchmarks against which agent performance is measured. These criteria are often task-specific and may include:

- **Task Completion Rate:** The percentage of tasks successfully completed by the agent.
- **Error Rate:** The frequency of errors made by the agent during task execution.
- **Resource Utilization:** How efficiently an agent uses resources such as memory and CPU.

### 3. The Process of Agent Evaluation

The evaluation process involves several steps, which can be visualized using Mermaid graphs:

#### a. Define Evaluation Metrics

The first step is to define the metrics that will be used to evaluate the agent. This involves identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the agent's tasks.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Evaluation Metrics] --> B[Identify KPIs]
    B --> C[Accuracy]
    B --> D[Precision and Recall]
    B --> E[F1 Score]
    B --> F[Response Time]
```

#### b. Collect Data

Data collection involves gathering information on the agent's performance. This data can come from logs, user feedback, or direct observations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Collect Data] --> B[Logs]
    A --> C[User Feedback]
    A --> D[Direct Observations]
```

#### c. Analyze Performance

Once data is collected, it is analyzed to assess the agent's performance against the defined metrics. This step may involve statistical analysis, machine learning models, or other analytical techniques.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Analyze Performance] --> B[Statistical Analysis]
    A --> C[Machine Learning Models]
    A --> D[Other Analytical Techniques]
```

#### d. Generate Reports

After analysis, performance reports are generated. These reports provide insights into how well the agent is performing and identify areas for improvement.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Generate Reports] --> B[Performance Insights]
    B --> C[Identify Areas for Improvement]
```

### 4. Tracking Agent Accuracy

Accuracy tracking is a critical aspect of agent evaluation. It involves measuring how often an agent's actions or decisions are correct. The following steps outline the process of tracking agent accuracy:

#### a. Define Correctness Criteria

The first step is to define what constitutes a correct action or decision for the agent.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Correctness Criteria] --> B[Task-Specific Standards]
    B --> C[Action Accuracy]
    B --> D[Decision Accuracy]
```

#### b. Monitor Agent Actions

Agents' actions are continuously monitored to track their performance. This monitoring can be done in real-time or through periodic evaluations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monitor Agent Actions] --> B[Real-Time Monitoring]
    A --> C[Periodic Evaluations]
```

#### c. Compare Against Correctness Criteria

Each action or decision made by the agent is compared against the defined correctness criteria to determine its accuracy.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Compare Against Correctness Criteria] --> B[Evaluate Each Action]
    B --> C[Correct or Incorrect?]
```

#### d. Calculate Accuracy Metrics

Accuracy metrics are calculated based on the comparison results. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the agent's accuracy.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Calculate Accuracy Metrics] --> B[Accuracy Percentage]
    A --> C[Error Rate]
```

### 5. Measuring Agent Accuracy

Measuring agent accuracy involves several steps and considerations:

#### a. Data Labeling

To measure accuracy, the data used for evaluation must be accurately labeled. This involves annotating the data with the correct actions or decisions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Labeling] --> B[Annotate Data with Correct Actions]
    B --> C[Ensure Accuracy of Labels]
```

#### b. Establish Baseline Performance

A baseline performance level is established by evaluating a sample set of data. This baseline serves as a reference point for measuring improvements or declines in accuracy.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Establish Baseline Performance] --> B[Evaluate Sample Data]
    B --> C[Set Performance Benchmarks]
```

#### c. Regular Evaluations

Agents are regularly evaluated to measure their accuracy over time. This helps in tracking performance trends and identifying any deviations from the expected behavior.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Regular Evaluations] --> B[Track Performance Over Time]
    B --> C[Identify Performance Trends]
    B --> D[Detect Deviations]
```

#### d. Feedback and Improvement

Feedback from evaluations is used to improve the agent's performance. This may involve retraining the agent, adjusting its algorithms, or refining its decision-making processes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feedback and Improvement] --> B[Use Evaluation Feedback]
    B --> C[Retrain Agent]
    B --> D[Adjust Algorithms]
    B --> E[Refine Decision-Making Processes]
```

### 6. Visualizing Agent Evaluation with Mermaid Graphs

Mermaid graphs provide a clear and concise way to visualize the agent evaluation process. Here are some examples of how Mermaid graphs can be used:

#### a. Overall Evaluation Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Evaluation Metrics] --> B[Collect Data]
    B --> C[Analyze Performance]
    C --> D[Generate Reports]
```

#### b. Accuracy Tracking

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Correctness Criteria] --> B[Monitor Agent Actions]
    B --> C[Compare Against Correctness Criteria]
    C --> D[Calculate Accuracy Metrics]
```

#### c. Continuous Improvement Cycle

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Regular Evaluations] --> B[Track Performance Over Time]
    B --> C[Identify Performance Trends]
    C --> D[Detect Deviations]
    D --> E[Feedback and Improvement]
    E --> A
```

### 7. Case Study: Evaluating a Chatbot Agent

To illustrate the agent evaluation process, let's consider a case study involving a chatbot agent designed to assist customers in an e-commerce platform.

#### a. Define Evaluation Metrics

For the chatbot, key performance metrics might include:

- **Response Accuracy:** The percentage of correct responses provided by the chatbot.
- **Response Time:** The average time taken by the chatbot to respond to user queries.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Measured through user feedback and ratings.

#### b. Collect Data

Data is collected from chatbot interactions, including user queries, responses, and feedback.

#### c. Analyze Performance

Performance analysis involves comparing the chatbot's responses against a predefined set of correct responses and calculating accuracy metrics.

#### d. Generate Reports

Reports are generated to provide insights into the chatbot's performance, highlighting areas where it excels and areas needing improvement.

### 8. Best Practices for Agent Evaluation

Here are some best practices to ensure effective agent evaluation:

#### a. Use Realistic Scenarios

Evaluate agents in realistic scenarios that closely mimic real-world conditions. This ensures that the evaluation results are relevant and applicable.

#### b. Continuous Monitoring

Continuously monitor agent performance to detect and address issues promptly. This helps in maintaining high performance levels.

#### c. Incorporate User Feedback

User feedback is invaluable for improving agent performance. Incorporate feedback into the evaluation process to identify and rectify shortcomings.

#### d. Regular Updates

Regularly update the evaluation metrics and criteria to keep pace with evolving tasks and requirements.

### Conclusion

Agent evaluation mechanisms are vital for ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of autonomous agents. By defining clear evaluation metrics, continuously monitoring performance, and using feedback for improvement, we can develop agents that consistently perform at high levels. Visualizing the evaluation process with tools like Mermaid graphs further aids in understanding and communication. Through diligent evaluation and continuous improvement, we can harness the full potential of autonomous agents in various applications.

# Building a Multi-Agent System for Real-Time Financial Analysis: A Comprehensive Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a sophisticated multi-agent system for real-time financial analysis using the Swarms framework. This system is designed for financial analysts and developer analysts who want to leverage AI and multiple data sources to gain deeper insights into stock performance, market trends, and economic indicators.

Before we dive into the code, let's briefly introduce the Swarms framework. Swarms is an innovative open-source project that simplifies the creation and management of AI agents. It's particularly well-suited for complex tasks like financial analysis, where multiple specialized agents can work together to provide comprehensive insights.

For more information and to contribute to the project, visit the [Swarms GitHub repository](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms). We highly recommend exploring the documentation for a deeper understanding of Swarms' capabilities.

Additional resources:

- [Swarms Twitter](https://x.com/swarms_corp) for updates
- [Swarms Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2HLiswhmUaMdjHC8AUHcCF?si=c831ef10c5ef4994) for podcasts
- [Swarms Blog](https://medium.com/@kyeg) for in-depth articles
- [Swarms Website](https://swarms.xyz) for an overview of the project

Now, let's break down our financial analysis system step by step.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
First install the necessary packages:

```bash
$ pip3 install -U swarms yfiance swarm_models fredapi pandas 
```

First, we need to set up our environment and import the necessary libraries:

```python
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import yfinance as yf
import requests
from fredapi import Fred
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
import aiohttp
from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# API keys
POLYGON_API_KEY = os.getenv('POLYGON_API_KEY')
FRED_API_KEY = os.getenv('FRED_API_KEY')
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize FRED client
fred_client = Fred(api_key=FRED_API_KEY)

# Polygon API base URL
POLYGON_BASE_URL = "https://api.polygon.io"
```

This section sets up our environment, imports necessary libraries, and initializes our API keys and clients. We're using `dotenv` to securely manage our API keys, and we've set up logging to track the execution of our script.

## Step 2: Implementing Rate Limiting

To respect API rate limits, we implement rate limiting decorators:

```python
@sleep_and_retry
@limits(calls=5, period=60)  # Adjust these values based on your Polygon API tier
async def call_polygon_api(session, endpoint, params=None):
    url = f"{POLYGON_BASE_URL}{endpoint}"
    params = params or {}
    params['apiKey'] = POLYGON_API_KEY
    async with session.get(url, params=params) as response:
        response.raise_for_status()
        return await response.json()

@sleep_and_retry
@limits(calls=120, period=60)  # FRED allows 120 requests per minute
def call_fred_api(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
```

These decorators ensure that we don't exceed the rate limits for our API calls. The `call_polygon_api` function is designed to work with asynchronous code, while `call_fred_api` is a wrapper for synchronous FRED API calls.

## Step 3: Implementing Data Fetching Functions

Next, we implement functions to fetch data from various sources:

### Yahoo Finance Integration

```python
async def get_yahoo_finance_data(session, ticker, period="1d", interval="1m"):
    try:
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        hist = await asyncio.to_thread(stock.history, period=period, interval=interval)
        info = await asyncio.to_thread(lambda: stock.info)
        return hist, info
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching Yahoo Finance data for {ticker}: {e}")
        return None, None

async def get_yahoo_finance_realtime(session, ticker):
    try:
        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        return await asyncio.to_thread(lambda: stock.fast_info)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching Yahoo Finance realtime data for {ticker}: {e}")
        return None
```

These functions fetch historical and real-time data from Yahoo Finance. We use `asyncio.to_thread` to run the synchronous `yfinance` functions in a separate thread, allowing our main event loop to continue running.

### Polygon.io Integration

```python
async def get_polygon_realtime_data(session, ticker):
    try:
        trades = await call_polygon_api(session, f"/v2/last/trade/{ticker}")
        quotes = await call_polygon_api(session, f"/v2/last/nbbo/{ticker}")
        return trades, quotes
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching Polygon.io realtime data for {ticker}: {e}")
        return None, None

async def get_polygon_news(session, ticker, limit=10):
    try:
        news = await call_polygon_api(session, f"/v2/reference/news", params={"ticker": ticker, "limit": limit})
        return news.get('results', [])
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching Polygon.io news for {ticker}: {e}")
        return []
```

These functions fetch real-time trade and quote data, as well as news articles from Polygon.io. We use our `call_polygon_api` function to make these requests, ensuring we respect rate limits.

### FRED Integration

```python
async def get_fred_data(session, series_id, start_date, end_date):
    try:
        data = await asyncio.to_thread(call_fred_api, fred_client.get_series, series_id, start_date, end_date)
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching FRED data for {series_id}: {e}")
        return None

async def get_fred_realtime(session, series_ids):
    try:
        data = {}
        for series_id in series_ids:
            series = await asyncio.to_thread(call_fred_api, fred_client.get_series, series_id)
            data[series_id] = series.iloc[-1]  # Get the most recent value
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching FRED realtime data: {e}")
        return {}
```

These functions fetch historical and real-time economic data from FRED. Again, we use `asyncio.to_thread` to run the synchronous FRED API calls in a separate thread.

## Step 4: Creating Specialized Agents

Now we create our specialized agents using the Swarms framework:

```python
stock_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="StockAgent",
    system_prompt="""You are an expert stock analyst. Your task is to analyze real-time stock data and provide insights. 
    Consider price movements, trading volume, and any available company information. 
    Provide a concise summary of the stock's current status and any notable trends or events.""",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
)

market_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="MarketAgent",
    system_prompt="""You are a market analysis expert. Your task is to analyze overall market conditions using real-time data. 
    Consider major indices, sector performance, and market-wide trends. 
    Provide a concise summary of current market conditions and any significant developments.""",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
)

macro_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="MacroAgent",
    system_prompt="""You are a macroeconomic analysis expert. Your task is to analyze key economic indicators and provide insights on the overall economic situation. 
    Consider GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment figures, and other relevant economic data. 
    Provide a concise summary of the current economic situation and any potential impacts on financial markets.""",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
)

news_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="NewsAgent",
    system_prompt="""You are a financial news analyst. Your task is to analyze recent news articles related to specific stocks or the overall market. 
    Consider the potential impact of news events on stock prices or market trends. 
    Provide a concise summary of key news items and their potential market implications.""",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

Each agent is specialized in a different aspect of financial analysis. The `system_prompt` for each agent defines its role and the type of analysis it should perform.

## Step 5: Building the Multi-Agent System

We then combine our specialized agents into a multi-agent system:

```python
agents = [stock_agent, market_agent, macro_agent, news_agent]
flow = "StockAgent -> MarketAgent -> MacroAgent -> NewsAgent"

agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)
```

The `flow` variable defines the order in which our agents will process information. This allows for a logical progression from specific stock analysis to broader market and economic analysis.

## Step 6: Implementing Real-Time Analysis

Now we implement our main analysis function:

```python
async def real_time_analysis(session, ticker):
    logger.info(f"Starting real-time analysis for {ticker}")
    
    # Fetch real-time data
    yf_data, yf_info = await get_yahoo_finance_data(session, ticker)
    yf_realtime = await get_yahoo_finance_realtime(session, ticker)
    polygon_trades, polygon_quotes = await get_polygon_realtime_data(session, ticker)
    polygon_news = await get_polygon_news(session, ticker)
    fred_data = await get_fred_realtime(session, ['GDP', 'UNRATE', 'CPIAUCSL'])

    # Prepare input for the multi-agent system
    input_data = f"""
    Yahoo Finance Data:
    {yf_realtime}

    Recent Stock History:
    {yf_data.tail().to_string() if yf_data is not None else 'Data unavailable'}

    Polygon.io Trade Data:
    {polygon_trades}

    Polygon.io Quote Data:
    {polygon_quotes}

    Recent News:
    {polygon_news[:3] if polygon_news else 'No recent news available'}

    Economic Indicators:
    {fred_data}

    Analyze this real-time financial data for {ticker}. Provide insights on the stock's performance, overall market conditions, relevant economic factors, and any significant news that might impact the stock or market.
    """

    # Run the multi-agent analysis
    try:
        analysis = agent_system.run(input_data)
        logger.info(f"Analysis completed for {ticker}")
        return analysis
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during multi-agent analysis for {ticker}: {e}")
        return f"Error during analysis: {e}"
```

This function fetches data from all our sources, prepares it as input for our multi-agent system, and then runs the analysis. The result is a comprehensive analysis of the stock, considering individual performance, market conditions, economic factors, and relevant news.

## Step 7: Implementing Advanced Use Cases

We then implement more advanced analysis functions:

### Compare Stocks

```python
async def compare_stocks(session, tickers):
    results = {}
    for ticker in tickers:
        results[ticker] = await real_time_analysis(session, ticker)
    
    comparison_prompt = f"""
    Compare the following stocks based on the provided analyses:
    {results}

    Highlight key differences and similarities. Provide a ranking of these stocks based on their current performance and future prospects.
    """
    
    try:
        comparison = agent_system.run(comparison_prompt)
        logger.info(f"Stock comparison completed for {tickers}")
        return comparison
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during stock comparison: {e}")
        return f"Error during comparison: {e}"
```

This function compares multiple stocks by running a real-time analysis on each and then prompting our multi-agent system to compare the results.

### Sector Analysis

```python
async def sector_analysis(session, sector):
    sector_stocks = {
        'Technology': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'NVDA'],
        'Finance': ['JPM', 'BAC', 'WFC', 'C', 'GS'],
        'Healthcare': ['JNJ', 'UNH', 'PFE', 'ABT', 'MRK'],
        'Consumer Goods': ['PG', 'KO', 'PEP', 'COST', 'WMT'],
        'Energy': ['XOM', 'CVX', 'COP', 'SLB', 'EOG']
    }
    
    if sector not in sector_stocks:
        return f"Sector '{sector}' not found. Available sectors: {', '.join(sector_stocks.keys())}"
    
    stocks = sector_stocks[sector][:5]
    
    sector_data = {}
    for stock in stocks:
        sector_data[stock] = await real_time_analysis(session, stock)
    
    sector_prompt = f"""
    Analyze the {sector} sector based on the following data from its top stocks:
    {sector_data}

    Provide insights on:
    1. Overall sector performance
    2. Key trends within the sector
    3. Top performing stocks and why they're outperforming
    4. Any challenges or opportunities facing the sector
    """
    
    try:
        analysis = agent_system.run(sector_prompt)
        logger.info(f"Sector analysis completed for {sector}")
        return analysis
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during sector analysis for {sector}: {e}")
        return f"Error during sector analysis: {e}"
```

This function analyzes an entire sector by running real-time analysis on its top stocks and then prompting our multi-agent system to provide sector-wide insights.

### Economic Impact Analysis

```python
async def economic_impact_analysis(session, indicator, threshold):
    # Fetch historical data for the indicator
    end_date = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    start_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    indicator_data = await get_fred_data(session, indicator, start_date, end_date)
    
    if indicator_data is None or len(indicator_data) < 2:
        return f"Insufficient data for indicator {indicator}"
    
    # Check if the latest value crosses the threshold
    latest_value = indicator_data.iloc[-1]
    previous_value = indicator_data.iloc[-2]
    crossed_threshold = (latest_value > threshold and previous_value <= threshold) or (latest_value < threshold and previous_value >= threshold)
    
    if crossed_threshold:
        impact_prompt = f"""
        The economic indicator {indicator} has crossed the threshold of {threshold}. Its current value is {latest_value}.

        Historical data:
        {indicator_data.tail().to_string()}

        Analyze the potential impacts of this change on:
        1. Overall economic conditions
        2. Different market
        2. Different market sectors
        3. Specific types of stocks (e.g., growth vs. value)
        4. Other economic indicators

        Provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential consequences and any recommended actions for investors.
        """
        
        try:
            analysis = agent_system.run(impact_prompt)
            logger.info(f"Economic impact analysis completed for {indicator}")
            return analysis
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error during economic impact analysis for {indicator}: {e}")
            return f"Error during economic impact analysis: {e}"
    else:
        return f"The {indicator} indicator has not crossed the threshold of {threshold}. Current value: {latest_value}"
```

This function analyzes the potential impact of significant changes in economic indicators. It fetches historical data, checks if a threshold has been crossed, and if so, prompts our multi-agent system to provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential consequences.

## Step 8: Running the Analysis

Finally, we implement our main function to run all of our analyses:

```python
async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Example usage
        analysis_result = await real_time_analysis(session, 'AAPL')
        print("Single Stock Analysis:")
        print(analysis_result)

        comparison_result = await compare_stocks(session, ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT'])
        print("\nStock Comparison:")
        print(comparison_result)

        tech_sector_analysis = await sector_analysis(session, 'Technology')
        print("\nTechnology Sector Analysis:")
        print(tech_sector_analysis)

        gdp_impact = await economic_impact_analysis(session, 'GDP', 22000)
        print("\nEconomic Impact Analysis:")
        print(gdp_impact)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This `main` function demonstrates how to use all of our analysis functions. It runs a single stock analysis, compares multiple stocks, performs a sector analysis, and conducts an economic impact analysis.

## Introduction to Swarms Framework

The Swarms framework is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI agents that can interact with various data sources and perform complex analyses. In the context of financial data analysis, Swarms can be used to create intelligent agents that can process large volumes of financial data, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions. Explore our github for examples, applications, and more.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we dive into connecting AI agents with financial data providers, let's set up our environment:

1. Install the Swarms framework:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

2. Install additional required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests pandas numpy matplotlib
```

3. Set up your API keys for the various financial data providers. It's recommended to use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store these keys.

## Connecting AI Agents with Financial Data Providers

Now, let's explore how to connect AI agents using the Swarms framework with different financial data providers.

### Polygon.io

First, we'll create an AI agent that can fetch and analyze stock data from Polygon.io.

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import requests
import pandas as pd

load_dotenv()

# Polygon.io API setup
POLYGON_API_KEY = os.getenv("POLYGON_API_KEY")
POLYGON_BASE_URL = "https://api.polygon.io/v2"

# OpenAI API setup
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant. Your task is to analyze stock data and provide insights.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_stock_data(symbol, from_date, to_date):
    endpoint = f"{POLYGON_BASE_URL}/aggs/ticker/{symbol}/range/1/day/{from_date}/{to_date}"
    params = {
        'apiKey': POLYGON_API_KEY,
        'adjusted': 'true'
    }
    response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    return pd.DataFrame(data['results'])

# Example usage
symbol = "AAPL"
from_date = "2023-01-01"
to_date = "2023-12-31"

stock_data = get_stock_data(symbol, from_date, to_date)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following stock data for {symbol} from {from_date} to {to_date}:

{stock_data.to_string()}

Provide insights on the stock's performance, including trends, volatility, and any notable events.
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

In this example, we've created an AI agent that can fetch stock data from Polygon.io and perform an analysis based on that data. The agent uses the GPT-4 model to generate insights about the stock's performance.

### Alpha Vantage

Next, let's create an agent that can work with Alpha Vantage data to perform fundamental analysis.

```python
import os

OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Fundamental-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant specializing in fundamental analysis. Your task is to analyze company financials and provide insights.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_income_statement(symbol):
    params = {
        'function': 'INCOME_STATEMENT',
        'symbol': symbol,
        'apikey': ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
    }
    response = requests.get(ALPHA_VANTAGE_BASE_URL, params=params)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
symbol = "MSFT"

income_statement = get_income_statement(symbol)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following income statement data for {symbol}:

{income_statement}

Provide insights on the company's financial health, profitability trends, and any notable observations.
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This example demonstrates an AI agent that can fetch income statement data from Alpha Vantage and perform a fundamental analysis of a company's financials.

### Yahoo Finance

Now, let's create an agent that can work with Yahoo Finance data to perform technical analysis.

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import yfinance as yf

model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Technical-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant specializing in technical analysis. Your task is to analyze stock price data and provide insights on trends and potential trading signals.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return data

# Example usage
symbol = "GOOGL"
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2023-12-31"

stock_data = get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date)

# Calculate some technical indicators
stock_data['SMA_20'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
stock_data['SMA_50'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following stock price data and technical indicators for {symbol} from {start_date} to {end_date}:

{stock_data.tail(30).to_string()}

Provide insights on the stock's price trends, potential support and resistance levels, and any notable trading signals based on the moving averages.
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This example shows an AI agent that can fetch stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculate some basic technical indicators, and perform a technical analysis.

### IEX Cloud

Let's create an agent that can work with IEX Cloud data to analyze company news sentiment.

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import requests

load_dotenv()

# IEX Cloud API setup
IEX_CLOUD_API_KEY = os.getenv("IEX_CLOUD_API_KEY")
IEX_CLOUD_BASE_URL = "https://cloud.iexapis.com/stable"

# OpenAI API setup
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="News-Sentiment-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant specializing in news sentiment analysis. Your task is to analyze company news and provide insights on the overall sentiment and potential impact on the stock.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_company_news(symbol, last_n):
    endpoint = f"{IEX_CLOUD_BASE_URL}/stock/{symbol}/news/last/{last_n}"
    params = {'token': IEX_CLOUD_API_KEY}
    response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
symbol = "TSLA"
last_n = 10

news_data = get_company_news(symbol, last_n)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following recent news articles for {symbol}:

{news_data}

Provide insights on the overall sentiment of the news, potential impact on the stock price, and any notable trends or events mentioned.
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This example demonstrates an AI agent that can fetch recent news data from IEX Cloud and perform a sentiment analysis on the company news.

### Finnhub

Finally, let's create an agent that can work with Finnhub data to analyze earnings estimates and recommendations.

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import finnhub

load_dotenv()

# Finnhub API setup
FINNHUB_API_KEY = os.getenv("FINNHUB_API_KEY")
finnhub_client = finnhub.Client(api_key=FINNHUB_API_KEY)

# OpenAI API setup
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Earnings-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant specializing in earnings analysis. Your task is to analyze earnings estimates and recommendations to provide insights on a company's financial outlook.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_earnings_estimates(symbol):
    return finnhub_client.earnings_calendar(symbol=symbol, from_date="2023-01-01", to_date="2023-12-31")

def get_recommendations(symbol):
    return finnhub_client.recommendation_trends(symbol)

# Example usage
symbol = "NVDA"

earnings_estimates = get_earnings_estimates(symbol)
recommendations = get_recommendations(symbol)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following earnings estimates and recommendations for {symbol}:

Earnings Estimates:
{earnings_estimates}

Recommendations:
{recommendations}

Provide insights on the company's expected financial performance, analyst sentiment, and any notable trends in the recommendations.
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This example shows an AI agent that can fetch earnings estimates and analyst recommendations from Finnhub and perform an analysis on the company's financial outlook.

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

To further enhance the capabilities of our AI agents, we can implement more advanced analysis techniques:

1. Multi-source analysis: Combine data from multiple providers to get a more comprehensive view of a stock or market.

2. Time series forecasting: Implement machine learning models for price prediction.

3. Sentiment analysis of social media: Incorporate data from social media platforms to gauge market sentiment.

4. Portfolio optimization: Use AI agents to suggest optimal portfolio allocations based on risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. Anomaly detection: Implement algorithms to detect unusual patterns or events in financial data.

Here's an example of how we might implement a multi-source analysis:

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import yfinance as yf
import requests
import pandas as pd

load_dotenv()

# API setup
POLYGON_API_KEY = os.getenv("POLYGON_API_KEY")
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = os.getenv("ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY")
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Multi-Source-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant capable of analyzing data from multiple sources. Your task is to provide comprehensive insights on a stock based on various data points.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_stock_data_yf(symbol, start_date, end_date):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    return stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)

def get_stock_data_polygon(symbol, from_date, to_date):
    endpoint = f"https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/{symbol}/range/1/day/{from_date}/{to_date}"
    params = {'apiKey': POLYGON_API_KEY, 'adjusted': 'true'}
    response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    return pd.DataFrame(data['results'])

def get_company_overview_av(symbol):
    params = {
        'function': 'OVERVIEW',
        'symbol': symbol,
        'apikey': ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
    }
    response = requests.get("https://www.alphavantage.co/query", params=params)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
symbol = "AAPL"
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2023-12-31"

yf_data = get_stock_data_yf(symbol, start_date, end_date)
polygon_data = get_stock_data_polygon(symbol, start_date, end_date)
av_overview = get_company_overview_av(symbol)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following data for {symbol} from {start_date} to {end_date}:

Yahoo Finance Data:
{yf_data.tail().to_string()}

Polygon.io Data:
{polygon_data.tail().to_string()}

Alpha Vantage Company Overview:
{av_overview}

Provide a comprehensive analysis of the stock, including:
1. Price trends and volatility
2. Trading volume analysis
3. Fundamental analysis based on the company overview
4. Any discrepancies between data sources and potential reasons
5. Overall outlook and potential risks/opportunities
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This multi-source analysis example combines data from Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, and Alpha Vantage to provide a more comprehensive view of a stock. The AI agent can then analyze this diverse set of data to provide deeper insights.

Now, let's explore some additional advanced analysis techniques:

### Time Series Forecasting

We can implement a simple time series forecasting model using the Prophet library and integrate it with our AI agent:

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

load_dotenv()

OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1
)

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Time-Series-Forecast-Agent",
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis AI assistant specializing in time series forecasting. Your task is to analyze stock price predictions and provide insights.",
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True
)

def get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return data

def forecast_stock_price(data, periods=30):
    df = data.reset_index()[['Date', 'Close']]
    df.columns = ['ds', 'y']
    
    model = Prophet()
    model.fit(df)
    
    future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=periods)
    forecast = model.predict(future)
    
    fig = model.plot(forecast)
    plt.savefig('forecast_plot.png')
    plt.close()
    
    return forecast

# Example usage
symbol = "MSFT"
start_date = "2020-01-01"
end_date = "2023-12-31"

stock_data = get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date)
forecast = forecast_stock_price(stock_data)

analysis_request = f"""
Analyze the following time series forecast for {symbol}:

Forecast Data:
{forecast.tail(30).to_string()}

The forecast plot has been saved as 'forecast_plot.png'.

Provide insights on:
1. The predicted trend for the stock price
2. Any seasonal patterns observed
3. Potential factors that might influence the forecast
4. Limitations of this forecasting method
5. Recommendations for investors based on this forecast
"""

analysis = agent.run(analysis_request)
print(analysis)
```

This example demonstrates how to integrate a time series forecasting model (Prophet) with our AI agent. The agent can then provide insights based on the forecasted data.

### Sentiment Analysis of Social Media

We can use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to analyze tweets about a company and integrate this with our AI agent:

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob
import pandas as pd

load_dotenv()

# Twitter API setup
TWITTER_API_KEY = os.getenv("TWITTER_API_KEY")
TWITTER_API_SECRET = os.getenv("TWITTER_API_SECRET")
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN")
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET")

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET)
auth.set_access_token(TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

## 1. Introduction to LLM Pricing Models

The pricing of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complex landscape that can significantly impact an enterprise's bottom line. As we dive into this topic, it's crucial to understand the various pricing models employed by LLM providers and how they align with different business needs.

### Pay-per-Token Model

The most common pricing structure in the LLM market is the pay-per-token model. In this system, businesses are charged based on the number of tokens processed by the model. A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word, depending on the language and the specific tokenization method used by the model.

**Advantages:**
- Scalability: Costs scale directly with usage, allowing for flexibility as demand fluctuates.
- Transparency: Easy to track and attribute costs to specific projects or departments.

**Disadvantages:**
- Unpredictability: Costs can vary significantly based on the verbosity of inputs and outputs.
- Potential for overruns: Without proper monitoring, costs can quickly escalate.

### Subscription-Based Models

Some providers offer subscription tiers that provide a set amount of compute resources or tokens for a fixed monthly or annual fee.

**Advantages:**
- Predictable costs: Easier budgeting and financial planning.
- Potential cost savings: Can be more economical for consistent, high-volume usage.

**Disadvantages:**
- Less flexibility: May lead to underutilization or overages.
- Commitment required: Often involves longer-term contracts.

### Custom Enterprise Agreements

For large-scale deployments, providers may offer custom pricing agreements tailored to the specific needs of an enterprise.

**Advantages:**
- Optimized for specific use cases: Can include specialized support, SLAs, and pricing structures.
- Potential for significant cost savings at scale.

**Disadvantages:**
- Complexity: Negotiating and managing these agreements can be resource-intensive.
- Less standardization: Difficult to compare across providers.

### Hybrid Models

Some providers are beginning to offer hybrid models that combine elements of pay-per-token and subscription-based pricing.

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility: Can adapt to varying usage patterns.
- Risk mitigation: Balances the benefits of both main pricing models.

**Disadvantages:**
- Complexity: Can be more challenging to understand and manage.
- Potential for suboptimal pricing if not carefully structured.

As we progress through this guide, we'll explore how these pricing models interact with various business considerations and how executives can leverage this understanding to make informed decisions.

## 2. Understanding Unit Economics in LLM Deployment

To make informed decisions about LLM deployment, executives must have a clear grasp of the unit economics involved. This section breaks down the components that contribute to the cost per unit of LLM usage and how they impact overall business economics.

### Defining the Unit

In the context of LLMs, a "unit" can be defined in several ways:

1. **Per Token**: The most granular unit, often used in pricing models.
2. **Per Request**: A single API call to the LLM, which may process multiple tokens.
3. **Per Task**: A complete operation, such as generating a summary or answering a question, which may involve multiple requests.
4. **Per User Interaction**: In customer-facing applications, this could be an entire conversation or session.

Understanding which unit is most relevant to your use case is crucial for accurate economic analysis.

### Components of Unit Cost

1. **Direct LLM Costs**
   - Token processing fees
   - API call charges
   - Data transfer costs

2. **Indirect Costs**
   - Compute resources for pre/post-processing
   - Storage for inputs, outputs, and fine-tuning data
   - Networking costs

3. **Operational Costs**
   - Monitoring and management tools
   - Integration and maintenance engineering time
   - Customer support related to AI functions

4. **Overhead**
   - Legal and compliance costs
   - Training and documentation
   - Risk management and insurance

### Calculating Unit Economics

To calculate the true unit economics, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Total Costs**: Sum all direct, indirect, operational, and overhead costs over a fixed period (e.g., monthly).

2. **Measure Total Units**: Track the total number of relevant units processed in the same period.

3. **Calculate Cost per Unit**: Divide total costs by total units.

   ```
   Cost per Unit = Total Costs / Total Units
   ```

4. **Analyze Revenue per Unit**: If the LLM is part of a revenue-generating product, calculate the revenue attributed to each unit.

5. **Determine Profit per Unit**: Subtract the cost per unit from the revenue per unit.

   ```
   Profit per Unit = Revenue per Unit - Cost per Unit
   ```

### Example Calculation

Let's consider a hypothetical customer service AI chatbot:

- Monthly LLM API costs: $10,000
- Indirect and operational costs: $5,000
- Total monthly interactions: 100,000

```
Cost per Interaction = ($10,000 + $5,000) / 100,000 = $0.15
```

If each interaction generates an average of $0.50 in value (through cost savings or revenue):

```
Profit per Interaction = $0.50 - $0.15 = $0.35
```

### Economies of Scale

As usage increases, unit economics often improve due to:

- Volume discounts from LLM providers
- Amortization of fixed costs over more units
- Efficiency gains through learning and optimization

However, it's crucial to model how these economies of scale manifest in your specific use case, as they may plateau or even reverse at very high volumes due to increased complexity and support needs.

### Diseconomies of Scale

Conversely, be aware of potential diseconomies of scale:

- Increased complexity in managing large-scale deployments
- Higher costs for specialized talent as operations grow
- Potential for diminishing returns on very large language models

By thoroughly understanding these unit economics, executives can make more informed decisions about which LLM provider and pricing model best aligns with their business objectives and scale.

## 3. Profit Margins and Cost Structures

Understanding profit margins and cost structures is crucial for executives evaluating LLM integration. This section explores how different pricing models and operational strategies can impact overall profitability.

### Components of Profit Margin

1. **Gross Margin**: The difference between revenue and the direct costs of LLM usage.
   ```
   Gross Margin = Revenue - Direct LLM Costs
   Gross Margin % = (Gross Margin / Revenue) * 100
   ```

2. **Contribution Margin**: Gross margin minus variable operational costs.
   ```
   Contribution Margin = Gross Margin - Variable Operational Costs
   ```

3. **Net Margin**: The final profit after all costs, including fixed overheads.
   ```
   Net Margin = Contribution Margin - Fixed Costs
   Net Margin % = (Net Margin / Revenue) * 100
   ```

### Cost Structures in LLM Deployment

1. **Fixed Costs**
   - Subscription fees for LLM access (if using a subscription model)
   - Base infrastructure costs
   - Core team salaries
   - Licensing fees for essential software

2. **Variable Costs**
   - Per-token or per-request charges
   - Scaling infrastructure costs
   - Usage-based API fees
   - Performance-based team bonuses

3. **Step Costs**
   - Costs that increase in chunks as usage scales
   - Examples: Adding new server clusters, hiring additional support staff

### Analyzing Profit Margins Across Different Pricing Models

Let's compare how different LLM pricing models might affect profit margins for a hypothetical AI-powered writing assistant service:

**Scenario**: The service charges users $20/month and expects to process an average of 100,000 tokens per user per month.

1. **Pay-per-Token Model**
   - LLM cost: $0.06 per 1,000 tokens
   - Monthly LLM cost per user: $6
   - Gross margin per user: $14 (70%)

2. **Subscription Model**
   - Fixed monthly fee: $5,000 for up to 10 million tokens
   - At 1,000 users: $5 per user
   - Gross margin per user: $15 (75%)

3. **Hybrid Model**
   - Base fee: $2,000 per month
   - Reduced per-token rate: $0.04 per 1,000 tokens
   - Monthly LLM cost per user: $6 ($2 base + $4 usage)
   - Gross margin per user: $14 (70%)

### Strategies for Improving Profit Margins

1. **Optimize Token Usage**
   - Implement efficient prompting techniques
   - Cache common responses
   - Use compression algorithms for inputs and outputs

2. **Leverage Economies of Scale**
   - Negotiate better rates at higher volumes
   - Spread fixed costs across a larger user base

3. **Implement Tiered Pricing**
   - Offer different service levels to capture more value from power users
   - Example: Basic ($10/month, 50K tokens), Pro ($30/month, 200K tokens)

4. **Vertical Integration**
   - Invest in proprietary LLM development for core functionalities
   - Reduce dependency on third-party providers for critical operations

5. **Smart Caching and Pre-computation**
   - Store and reuse common LLM outputs
   - Perform batch processing during off-peak hours

6. **Hybrid Cloud Strategies**
   - Use on-premises solutions for consistent workloads
   - Leverage cloud elasticity for demand spikes

### Case Study: Margin Improvement

Consider a company that initially used a pay-per-token model:

**Initial State:**
- Revenue per user: $20
- LLM cost per user: $6
- Other variable costs: $4
- Fixed costs per user: $5
- Net margin per user: $5 (25%)

**After Optimization:**
- Implemented efficient prompting: Reduced token usage by 20%
- Negotiated volume discount: 10% reduction in per-token price
- Introduced tiered pricing: Average revenue per user increased to $25
- Optimized operations: Reduced other variable costs to $3

**Result:**
- New LLM cost per user: $4.32
- New net margin per user: $12.68 (50.7%)

   - Assign monetary values to productivity gains and quality improvements
   - Estimate the value of strategic advantages (this may be more subjective)

3. **Calculate Total Costs**:
   - Sum up all direct and indirect costs related to LLM integration

4. **Apply the ROI Formula**:
   ```
   ROI = ((Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs) * 100
   ```

5. **Consider Time Value of Money**: For longer-term projections, use Net Present Value (NPV) to account for the time value of money.

### Example ROI Calculation

Let's consider a hypothetical customer service chatbot implementation:

**Time Period**: 1 year

**Benefits**:
- Labor cost savings: $500,000

ROI = (($1,000,000 - $350,000) / $350,000) * 100 = 185.7%
```

This indicates a strong positive return on investment, with benefits outweighing costs by a significant margin.

### Considerations for Accurate ROI Calculation

1. **Be Conservative in Estimates**: It's better to underestimate benefits and overestimate costs to provide a more realistic view.

2. **Account for Ramp-Up Time**: Full benefits may not be realized immediately. Consider a phased approach in your calculations.

3. **Include Opportunity Costs**: Consider the potential returns if the investment were made elsewhere.

4. **Factor in Risk**: Adjust your ROI based on the likelihood of achieving projected benefits.

5. **Consider Non-Financial Benefits**: Some benefits, like improved employee satisfaction or enhanced brand perception, may not have direct financial equivalents but are still valuable.

# Secure Communication Protocols

## Overview

The Swarms Multi-Agent Framework prioritizes the security and integrity of data, especially personal and sensitive information. Our Secure Communication Protocols ensure that all communications between agents are encrypted, authenticated, and resistant to tampering or unauthorized access.

## Features

### 1. End-to-End Encryption

- All inter-agent communications are encrypted using state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms.
- This ensures that data remains confidential and can only be read by the intended recipient agent.

### 2. Authentication

- Before initiating communication, agents authenticate each other using digital certificates.
- This prevents impersonation attacks and ensures that agents are communicating with legitimate counterparts.

### 3. Forward Secrecy

- Key exchange mechanisms employ forward secrecy, meaning that even if a malicious actor gains access to an encryption key, they cannot decrypt past communications.
  
### 4. Data Integrity

- Cryptographic hashes ensure that the data has not been altered in transit.
- Any discrepancies in data integrity result in the communication being rejected.

### 5. Zero-Knowledge Protocols

- When handling especially sensitive data, agents use zero-knowledge proofs to validate information without revealing the actual data.
  
### 6. Periodic Key Rotation

- To mitigate the risk of long-term key exposure, encryption keys are periodically rotated.
- Old keys are securely discarded, ensuring that even if they are compromised, they cannot be used to decrypt communications.

## Best Practices for Handling Personal and Sensitive Information

1. **Data Minimization**: Agents should only request and process the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the task.
2. **Anonymization**: Whenever possible, agents should anonymize personal data, stripping away identifying details.
3. **Data Retention Policies**: Personal data should be retained only for the period necessary to complete the task, after which it should be securely deleted.
4. **Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized agents have access to personal and sensitive information. Implement strict access control mechanisms.
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and to detect any potential vulnerabilities.
6. **Training**: All agents should be regularly updated and trained on the latest security protocols and best practices for handling sensitive data.

## Conclusion

Secure communication is paramount in the Swarms Multi-Agent Framework, especially when dealing with personal and sensitive information. Adhering to these protocols and best practices ensures the safety, privacy, and trust of all stakeholders involved.

# Swarms Protocol Overview & Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Swarms protocol architecture, illustrating the flow from agent classes to multi-agent structures, and showcasing the main components and folders within the `swarms/` package. The Swarms framework is designed for extensibility, modularity, and production-readiness, enabling the orchestration of intelligent agents, tools, memory, and complex multi-agent systems.

---

## Introduction

Swarms is an enterprise-grade, production-ready multi-agent orchestration framework. It enables developers and organizations to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents that can reason, collaborate, and solve complex tasks autonomously or in groups. The architecture is inspired by the principles of modularity, composability, and scalability, ensuring that each component can be extended or replaced as needed.

The protocol is structured to support a wide range of use cases, from simple single-agent automations to sophisticated multi-agent workflows involving memory, tool use, and advanced reasoning.

For a high-level introduction and installation instructions, see the [Swarms Docs Home](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/).

---

## High-Level Architecture Flow

The Swarms protocol is organized into several key layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system. The typical flow is as follows:

1. **Agent Class (`swarms/agents`)**
    
    - The core building block of the framework. Agents encapsulate logic, state, and behavior. They can be simple (stateless) or complex 
    (stateful, with memory and reasoning capabilities).
    
    - Agents can be specialized for different tasks (e.g., reasoning agents, tool agents, judge agents, etc.).
    
    - Example: A `ReasoningAgent` that can analyze data and make decisions, or a `ToolAgent` that wraps external APIs.
    
    - [Quickstart for Agents](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/agents/)
    
    - [Agent API Reference](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent/)

2. **Tools with Memory (`swarms/tools`, `swarms/utils`)**
    - Tools are modular components that agents use to interact with the outside world, perform computations, or access resources (APIs, 
    databases, files, etc.).

    - Memory modules and utility functions allow agents to retain context, cache results, and manage state across interactions.
    
    - Example: A tool for calling an LLM API, a memory cache for conversation history, or a utility for parsing and formatting data.
    
    - [Tools Overview](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms_tools/overview/)
    
    - [BaseTool Reference](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/tools/base_tool/)

3. **Reasoning & Specialized Agents (`swarms/agents`)**
    - These agents build on the base agent class, adding advanced reasoning, self-consistency, and specialized logic for tasks like 
    planning, evaluation, or multi-step workflows.

    - Includes agents for self-reflection, iterative improvement, and domain-specific expertise.

    - Example: A `SelfConsistencyAgent` that aggregates multiple reasoning paths, or a `JudgeAgent` that evaluates outputs from other 
    agents.

## Proposing Large Improvements or Enhancements: Swarms Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

For significant changes, new agent architectures, or radical new features, Swarms uses a formal process called **Swarms Improvement Proposals (SIPs)**. SIPs are design documents that describe new features, enhancements, or changes to the Swarms framework. They ensure that major changes are well-documented, discussed, and reviewed by the community before implementation.

**When to use a SIP:**

- Proposing new agent types, swarm patterns, or coordination mechanisms

- Core framework changes or breaking changes

- New integrations (LLM providers, tools, external services)

- Any complex or multi-component feature

**SIP Process Overview:**

1. Discuss your idea in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/discussions)

2. Submit a SIP as a GitHub Issue using the SIP template

3. Engage with the community and iterate on your proposal

4. Undergo review and, if accepted, proceed to implementation

## How the System Works Together

The Swarms protocol is designed for composability. Agents can be created and configured independently, then composed into larger structures (swarms) for collaborative or competitive workflows. Tools and memory modules are injected into agents as needed, enabling them to perform complex tasks and retain context. Multi-agent structures orchestrate the flow of information and decision-making, while supporting components (communication, telemetry, artifacts, etc.) ensure robustness, observability, and extensibility.

For example, a typical workflow might involve:

- Creating a set of specialized agents (e.g., data analyst, summarizer, judge).

- Registering tools (e.g., LLM API, database access, web search) and memory modules.

- Composing agents into a `MajorityVotingSwarm` for collaborative decision-making.

- Using communication wrappers to exchange data between agents and external systems.

- Logging all actions and outputs for traceability and debugging.


For more advanced examples, see the [Examples Overview](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/examples/index/).

---

## Swarms Framework Philosophy

Swarms is built on the following principles:

- **Modularity:** Every component (agent, tool, prompt, schema) is a module that can be extended or replaced.

- **Composability:** Agents and tools can be composed into larger structures for complex workflows.

- **Observability:** Telemetry and artifact management ensure that all actions are traceable and debuggable.

- **Extensibility:** New agents, tools, and workflows can be added with minimal friction.

- **Production-Readiness:** The framework is designed for reliability, scalability, and real-world deployment.


For more on the philosophy and architecture, see [Development Philosophy & Principles](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/concept/philosophy/) and [Understanding Swarms Architecture](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/concept/framework_architecture/).

### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one. `SequentialWorkflow` is Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents for a 3-step process
# 1. Generate an idea
idea_generator = Agent(agent_name="IdeaGenerator", system_prompt="Generate a unique startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 2. Validate the idea
validator = Agent(agent_name="Validator", system_prompt="Take this startup idea and analyze its market viability.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 3. Create a pitch
pitch_creator = Agent(agent_name="PitchCreator", system_prompt="Write a 3-sentence elevator pitch for this validated startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[idea_generator, validator, pitch_creator])

# Run the workflow
elevator_pitch = workflow.run()
print(elevator_pitch)
```

-----


### ConcurrentWorkflow (with `SpreadSheetSwarm`)

A concurrent workflow runs multiple agents simultaneously. `SpreadSheetSwarm` is a powerful implementation that can manage thousands of concurrent agents and log their outputs to a CSV file. Use this architecture for high-throughput tasks that can be performed in parallel, drastically reducing execution time.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SpreadSheetSwarm

# Define a list of tasks (e.g., social media posts to generate)
platforms = ["Twitter", "LinkedIn", "Instagram"]

# Create an agent for each task
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name=f"{platform}-Marketer",
        system_prompt=f"Generate a real estate marketing post for {platform}.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    for platform in platforms
]

# Initialize the swarm to run these agents concurrently
swarm = SpreadSheetSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    autosave_on=True,
    save_file_path="marketing_posts.csv",
)

# Run the swarm with a single, shared task description
property_description = "A beautiful 3-bedroom house in sunny California."
swarm.run(task=f"Generate a post about: {property_description}")
# Check marketing_posts.csv for the results!
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax. [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is Perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, sequence, or a combination of both.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the system
# The researcher will generate content, and then both the writer and editor

### GraphWorkflow

`GraphWorkflow` orchestrates tasks using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing you to manage complex dependencies where some tasks must wait for others to complete.

**Description:** Essential for building sophisticated pipelines, like in software development or complex project management, where task order and dependencies are critical.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GraphWorkflow, Node, Edge, NodeType

# Define agents and a simple python function as nodes
code_generator = Agent(agent_name="CodeGenerator", system_prompt="Write Python code for the given task.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
code_tester = Agent(agent_name="CodeTester", system_prompt="Test the given Python code and find bugs.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create nodes for the graph
node1 = Node(id="generator", agent=code_generator)
node2 = Node(id="tester", agent=code_tester)

# Create the graph and define the dependency
graph = GraphWorkflow()
graph.add_nodes([node1, node2])
graph.add_edge(Edge(source="generator", target="tester")) # Tester runs after generator

# Set entry and end points
graph.set_entry_points(["generator"])
graph.set_end_points(["tester"])

# Run the graph workflow
results = graph.run("Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.")
print(results)
``` -->

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm. Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

This makes your code cleaner and more flexible, allowing you to switch between different multi-agent strategies with ease. Here's a complete example that shows how to define agents and then use `SwarmRouter` to execute the same task using different collaborative strategies.

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```


The `SwarmRouter` is a powerful tool for simplifying multi-agent orchestration. It provides a consistent and flexible way to deploy different collaborative strategies, allowing you to build more sophisticated applications with less code.

-------

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result. [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

----

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically. This architecture is ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```

## 1. Introduction

`AbstractAgent` is an abstract class that serves as a foundation for implementing AI agents. An agent is an entity that can communicate with other agents and perform actions. The `AbstractAgent` class allows for customization in the implementation of the `receive` method, enabling different agents to define unique actions for receiving and processing messages.

`AbstractAgent` provides capabilities for managing tools and accessing memory, and has methods for running, chatting, and stepping through communication with other agents.

## 2. Class Definition

```python
class AbstractAgent:
    """An abstract class for AI agent.

    An agent can communicate with other agents and perform actions.
    Different agents can differ in what actions they perform in the `receive` method.

    Agents are full and completed:

    Agents = llm + tools + memory
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        """
        Args:
            name (str): name of the agent.
        """
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        """Get the name of the agent."""
        return self._name

    def tools(self, tools):
        """init tools"""

    def memory(self, memory_store):
        """init memory"""

    def reset(self):
        """(Abstract method) Reset the agent."""

    def run(self, task: str):
        """Run the agent once"""

    def _arun(self, taks: str):
        """Run Async run"""

    def chat(self, messages: List[Dict]):
        """Chat with the agent"""

    def _achat(self, messages: List[Dict]):
        """Asynchronous Chat"""

    def step(self, message: str):
        """Step through the agent"""

    def _astep(self, message: str):
        """Asynchronous step"""
```

## 3. Functionality and Usage

The `AbstractAgent` class represents a generic AI agent and provides a set of methods to interact with it.

To create an instance of an agent, the `name` of the agent should be specified.

### Core Methods

#### 1. `reset`

The `reset` method allows the agent to be reset to its initial state.

```python
agent.reset()
```

#### 2. `run`

The `run` method allows the agent to perform a specific task.

```python
agent.run("some_task")
```

#### 3. `chat`

The `chat` method enables communication with the agent through a series of messages.

```python
messages = [{"id": 1, "text": "Hello, agent!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "How are you?"}]
agent.chat(messages)
```

#### 4. `step`

The `step` method allows the agent to process a single message.

```python
agent.step("Hello, agent!")
```

### Asynchronous Methods

The class also provides asynchronous variants of the core methods.

### Additional Functionality

Additional functionalities for agent initialization and management of tools and memory are also provided.

```python
agent.tools(some_tools)
agent.memory(some_memory_store)
```

## 4. Additional Information and Tips

When implementing a new agent using the `AbstractAgent` class, ensure that the `receive` method is overridden to define the specific behavior of the agent upon receiving messages.

## 5. References and Resources

For further exploration and understanding of AI agents and agent communication, refer to the relevant literature and research on this topic.

]

# Process all tasks
results = agent.batched_run(tasks)

# Print results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Task {i+1} result: {result}")
```

## Key Features

### Self-Consistency Technique
The agent implements the self-consistency approach based on the research paper "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models" by Wang et al. (2022). This technique:

1. **Generates Multiple Independent Responses**: Creates several reasoning paths for the same problem
2. **Analyzes Consistency**: Examines agreement among different reasoning approaches
3. **Aggregates Results**: Uses majority voting or consensus building
4. **Produces Reliable Output**: Delivers a final answer reflecting the most reliable consensus

### Benefits
- **Mitigates Random Errors**: Multiple reasoning paths reduce individual path errors
- **Reduces Bias**: Diverse approaches minimize single-method biases
- **Improves Reliability**: Consensus-based results are more trustworthy
- **Handles Complexity**: Better performance on complex problem-solving tasks

### Use Cases
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Where accuracy is critical
- **Decision Making**: When reliability is paramount
- **Validation Tasks**: When answers need verification
- **Complex Reasoning**: Multi-step problem solving
- **Research Questions**: Where multiple perspectives are valuable

## Technical Details

### Concurrent Execution
The agent uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to generate multiple responses concurrently, improving performance while maintaining independence between reasoning paths.

### Aggregation Process
The aggregation uses an AI-powered agent that:
- Identifies dominant responses
- Analyzes disparities and disagreements
- Evaluates consensus strength
- Synthesizes minority insights
- Provides comprehensive recommendations

### Output Formats
The agent supports various output types:
- `"dict"`: Dictionary format with conversation history
- `"str"`: Simple string output
- `"list"`: List format
- `"json"`: JSON formatted output

## Limitations

1. **Computational Cost**: Higher `num_samples` increases processing time and cost
2. **Model Dependencies**: Performance depends on the underlying model capabilities
3. **Consensus Challenges**: May struggle with tasks where multiple valid approaches exist
4. **Memory Usage**: Concurrent execution requires more memory resources

## Best Practices

1. **Sample Size**: Use 3-7 samples for most tasks; increase for critical decisions
2. **Model Selection**: Choose models with strong reasoning capabilities
3. **Evaluation Mode**: Enable for tasks with known correct answers
4. **Custom Prompts**: Tailor majority voting prompts for specific domains
5. **Batch Processing**: Use `batched_run` for multiple related tasks

    autosave: false
    verbose: true
    context_length: 50000
    output_type: "json"
    task: "What are the riskiest stocks in the tech sector?"
```

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent

### How to Use `create_agents_from_yaml` Function with YAML:

- You need to plug in your specific model until we can create a model router that can fetch any model and set specific settings

#### Example Code:
```python
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from loguru import logger
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat

from swarms.agents.create_agents_from_yaml import (
    create_agents_from_yaml,
)

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Path to your YAML file
yaml_file = "agents.yaml"


# Get the OpenAI API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")

# Model
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_base="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    model_name="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    temperature=0.1,
)

try:
    # Create agents and run tasks (using 'both' to return agents and task results)
    task_results = create_agents_from_yaml(
        model=model, yaml_file=yaml_file, return_type="run_swarm" # 
    )

    logger.info(f"Results from agents: {task_results}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

---

### Error Handling:

1. **FileNotFoundError**: If the specified YAML file does not exist.
2. **ValueError**: Raised if there are invalid or missing configurations in the YAML file.
3. **Invalid Return Type**: If an invalid return type is specified, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Conclusion:
The `create_agents_from_yaml` function provides a flexible and powerful way to dynamically configure and execute agents, supporting a wide range of tasks and configurations for enterprise-level use cases. By following the YAML schema and function signature, users can easily define and manage their agents and swarms.

# **Swarms External Agent Integration**

Integrating external agents from other frameworks like **Langchain**, **Griptape**, and more is straightforward using **Swarms**. Below are step-by-step guides on how to bring these agents into Swarms by creating a new class, implementing the required methods, and ensuring compatibility.

---

## **Quick Overview**

- **Step 1**: Create a new class that inherits the `Agent` class from Swarms.
- **Step 2**: Override the `.run(task: str) -> str` method that will execute the agent and return a string response.
- **Step 3**: Optionally, add methods to save outputs to other formats like JSON, logs, or databases.

### **Agent Class**

The primary structure you'll need to integrate any external agent is the `Agent` class from **Swarms**. Here’s a template for how your new agent class should be structured:

```python
from swarms import Agent

class ExternalAgent(Agent):
    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Implement logic to run external agent
        pass

    def save_to_json(self, output: str, filepath: str):
        # Optionally save the result to a JSON file
        with open(filepath, "w") as file:
            json.dump({"response": output}, file)
```

---

## **Griptape Agent Integration Example**

In this example, we will create a **Griptape** agent by inheriting from the Swarms `Agent` class and implementing the `run` method.

### **Griptape Integration Steps**:

1. **Inherit from Swarms Agent**: Inherit from the `SwarmsAgent` class.
2. **Create Griptape Agent**: Initialize the **Griptape** agent inside your class and provide it with the necessary tools.
3. **Override the `run()` method**: Implement logic to process a task string and execute the Griptape agent.

## **Griptape Example Code**:

```python
from swarms import (
    Agent as SwarmsAgent,
)  # Import the base Agent class from Swarms
from griptape.structures import Agent as GriptapeAgent
from griptape.tools import (
    WebScraperTool,
    FileManagerTool,
    PromptSummaryTool,
)

# Create a custom agent class that inherits from SwarmsAgent
class GriptapeSwarmsAgent(SwarmsAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialize the Griptape agent with its tools
        self.agent = GriptapeAgent(
            input="Load {{ args[0] }}, summarize it, and store it in a file called {{ args[1] }}.",
            tools=[
                WebScraperTool(off_prompt=True),
                PromptSummaryTool(off_prompt=True),
                FileManagerTool(),
            ],
            *args,
            **kwargs,
        )

    # Override the run method to take a task and execute it using the Griptape agent
    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Extract URL and filename from task
        url, filename = task.split(",")  # Example task string: "https://example.com, output.txt"
        # Execute the Griptape agent
        result = self.agent.run(url.strip(), filename.strip())
        # Return the final result as a string
        return str(result)


# Example usage:
griptape_swarms_agent = GriptapeSwarmsAgent()
output = griptape_swarms_agent.run("https://griptape.ai, griptape.txt")
print(output)
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **GriptapeSwarmsAgent**: The custom class that integrates **Griptape** into **Swarms**.
2. **run(task: str)**: This method extracts inputs from the task string and runs the agent using **Griptape** tools.
3. **Tools**: The **Griptape** agent is equipped with web scraping, summarization, and file management tools.


## **Additional Features**:
You can enhance your external agents with additional features such as:

- **Saving outputs** to JSON, databases, or logs.

- **Handling errors** and retry mechanisms for robustness.

- **Custom logging** with tools like **Loguru** for extensive debugging.

---

## **Langchain Agent Integration Example**

Next, we demonstrate how to integrate a **Langchain** agent with **Swarms** by following similar steps.

### **Langchain Integration Steps**:

1. **Inherit from Swarms Agent**: Inherit from the `SwarmsAgent` class.
2. **Create Langchain Agent**: Initialize a Langchain agent with the necessary components (like language models or memory modules).
3. **Override the `run()` method**: Pass tasks to the Langchain agent and return the response.

## **Langchain Example Code**:

```python
from swarms import Agent as SwarmsAgent
from langchain import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Create a custom agent class that inherits from SwarmsAgent
class LangchainSwarmsAgent(SwarmsAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialize the Langchain agent with LLM and prompt
        prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template="Answer the question: {question}")
        llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
        self.chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    # Override the run method to take a task and execute it using the Langchain agent
    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Pass the task to the Langchain agent
        result = self.chain.run({"question": task})
        # Return the final result as a string
        return result

# Example usage:
langchain_swarms_agent = LangchainSwarmsAgent()
output = langchain_swarms_agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(output)
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **LangchainSwarmsAgent**: The custom class integrates **Langchain** into **Swarms**.
2. **run(task: str)**: The task is passed to a language model via Langchain and returns a result.

# Generated Knowledge Prompting (GKP) Agent

The GKP Agent is a sophisticated reasoning system that enhances its capabilities by generating relevant knowledge before answering queries. This approach, inspired by Liu et al. 2022, is particularly effective for tasks requiring commonsense reasoning and factual information.

## Overview

The GKP Agent consists of three main components:
1. Knowledge Generator - Creates relevant factual information
2. Reasoner - Uses generated knowledge to form answers
3. Coordinator - Synthesizes multiple reasoning paths into a final answer

## Architecture

    A[Input Query] --> B[Knowledge Generator]
    B --> C[Generate Knowledge Items]
    C --> D[Reasoner]
    D --> E[Multiple Reasoning Paths]
    E --> F[Coordinator]
    F --> G[Final Answer]

        try:
            response = agent.run(task)
            logger.info(f"Agent execution successful on attempt {attempt + 1}")
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {str(e)}")
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    
    return None

# Example usage

# Iterative Reflective Expansion (IRE) Algorithm Documentation

The Iterative Reflective Expansion (IRE) Algorithm is a sophisticated reasoning framework that employs iterative hypothesis generation, simulation, and refinement to solve complex problems. It leverages a multi-step approach where an AI agent generates initial solution paths, evaluates their effectiveness through simulation, reflects on errors, and dynamically revises reasoning strategies. Through continuous cycles of hypothesis testing and meta-cognitive reflection, the algorithm progressively converges on optimal solutions by learning from both successful and unsuccessful reasoning attempts.

# File: swarms\agents\message.md

# The Module/Class Name: Message

In the swarms.agents framework, the class `Message` is used to represent a message with timestamp and optional metadata.

## Overview and Introduction

The `Message` class is a fundamental component that enables the representation of messages within an agent system. Messages contain essential information such as the sender, content, timestamp, and optional metadata.

## Class Definition

### Constructor: `__init__`

The constructor of the `Message` class takes three parameters:

1. `sender` (str): The sender of the message.
2. `content` (str): The content of the message.
3. `metadata` (dict or None): Optional metadata associated with the message.

### Methods

1. `__repr__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the `Message` object, including the timestamp, sender, and content.

```python
class Message:
    """
    Represents a message with timestamp and optional metadata.

    Usage
    --------------
    mes = Message(
        sender = "Kye",
        content = "message"
    )

    print(mes)
    """

    def __init__(self, sender, content, metadata=None):
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.sender = sender
        self.content = content
        self.metadata = metadata or {}

    def __repr__(self):
        """
        __repr__ represents the string representation of the Message object.

        Returns:
        (str) A string containing the timestamp, sender, and content of the message.
        """
        return f"{self.timestamp} - {self.sender}: {self.content}"
```

## Functionality and Usage

The `Message` class represents a message in the agent system. Upon initialization, the `timestamp` is set to the current date and time, and the `metadata` is set to an empty dictionary if no metadata is provided.

### Usage Example 1

Creating a `Message` object and displaying its string representation.

```python
mes = Message(sender="Kye", content="Hello! How are you?")

print(mes)
```

Output:
```
2023-09-20 13:45:00 - Kye: Hello! How are you?
```

### Usage Example 2

Creating a `Message` object with metadata.

```python
metadata = {"priority": "high", "category": "urgent"}
mes_with_metadata = Message(
    sender="Alice", content="Important update", metadata=metadata
)

print(mes_with_metadata)
```

Output:
```
2023-09-20 13:46:00 - Alice: Important update
```

### Usage Example 3

Creating a `Message` object without providing metadata.

```python
mes_no_metadata = Message(sender="Bob", content="Reminder: Meeting at 2PM")

print(mes_no_metadata)
```

Output:
```
2023-09-20 13:47:00 - Bob: Reminder: Meeting at 2PM
```

## Additional Information and Tips

When creating a new `Message` object, ensure that the required parameters `sender` and `content` are provided. The `timestamp` will automatically be assigned the current date and time. Optional `metadata` can be included to provide additional context or information associated with the message.

## References and Resources

For further information on the `Message` class and its usage, refer to the official swarms.agents documentation and relevant tutorials related to message handling and communication within the agent system.

# How to Create Good Agents

This guide will walk you through the steps to build high-quality agents by extending the `Agent` class. It emphasizes best practices, the use of type annotations, comprehensive documentation, and modular design to ensure maintainability and scalability. Additionally, you will learn how to incorporate a callable `llm` parameter or specify a `model_name` attribute to enhance flexibility and functionality. These principles ensure that agents are not only functional but also robust and adaptable to future requirements.

## Overview

A good agent is a modular and reusable component designed to perform specific tasks efficiently. By inheriting from the base `Agent` class, developers can extend its functionality while adhering to standardized principles. Each custom agent should:

- Inherit from the `Agent` class to maintain compatibility with swarms.
- Define a `run(task: str, img: str)` method to execute tasks effectively.
- Include descriptive attributes such as `name`, `system_prompt`, and `description` to enhance clarity.
- Optionally, include an `llm` parameter (callable) or a `model_name` to enable seamless integration with language models.
- Emphasize modularity, allowing the agent to be reused across various contexts and tasks.

By following these guidelines, you can create agents that integrate well with broader systems and exhibit high reliability in real-world applications.

---

## Creating a Custom Agent

Here is a detailed template for creating a custom agent by inheriting the `Agent` class. This template demonstrates how to structure an agent with extendable and reusable features:

```python
from typing import Callable, Any
from swarms import Agent

class MyNewAgent(Agent):
    """
    A custom agent class for specialized tasks.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the agent.
        system_prompt (str): The prompt guiding the agent's behavior.
        description (str): A brief description of the agent's purpose.
        llm (Callable, optional): A callable representing the language model to use.
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, system_prompt: str, model_name: str = None, description: str, llm: Callable = None):
        """
        Initialize the custom agent.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the agent.
            system_prompt (str): The prompt guiding the agent.
            model_name (str): The name of your model can use litellm [openai/gpt-4o]
            description (str): A description of the agent's purpose.
            llm (Callable, optional): A callable representing the language model to use.
        """
        super().__init__(agent_name=name, system_prompt=system_prompt, model_name=model_name)
        self.agent_name = agent_name
        self.system_prompt system_prompt
        self.description = description
        self.model_name = model_name

    def run(self, task: str, img: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """
        Execute the task assigned to the agent.

        Args:
            task (str): The task description.
            img (str): The image input for processing.
            *args: Additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

        Returns:
            Any: The result of the task execution.
        """
        # Your custom logic 
        ...
```

This design ensures a seamless extension of functionality while maintaining clear and maintainable code.

---

## Key Considerations

### 1. **Type Annotations**
Always use type hints for method parameters and return values. This improves code readability, supports static analysis tools, and reduces bugs, ensuring long-term reliability.

### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
Provide detailed docstrings for all classes, methods, and attributes. Clear documentation ensures that your agent's functionality is understandable to both current and future collaborators.

### 3. **Modular Design**
Keep the agent logic modular and reusable. Modularity simplifies debugging, testing, and extending functionalities, making the code more adaptable to diverse scenarios.

### 4. **Flexible Model Integration**
Use either an `llm` callable or `model_name` attribute for integrating language models. This flexibility ensures your agent can adapt to various tasks, environments, and system requirements.

### 5. **Error Handling**
Incorporate robust error handling to manage unexpected inputs or issues during execution. This not only ensures reliability but also builds user trust in your system.

### 6. **Scalability Considerations**
Ensure your agent design can scale to accommodate increased complexity or a larger number of tasks without compromising performance.

---

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use your custom agent effectively:

```python
# Example LLM callable
class MockLLM:
    """
    A mock language model class for simulating LLM behavior.

    Methods:
        run(task: str, img: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> str:
            Processes the task and image input to return a simulated response.
    """

    def run(self, task: str, img: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> str:
        return f"Processed task '{task}' with image '{img}'"

# Create an instance of MyNewAgent
agent = MyNewAgent(
    name="ImageProcessor",
    system_prompt="Process images and extract relevant details.",
    description="An agent specialized in processing images and extracting insights.",
    llm=MockLLM().run
)

# Run a task
result = agent.run(task="Analyze content", img="path/to/image.jpg")
print(result)
```

This example showcases the practical application of the `MyNewAgent` class and highlights its extensibility.


## Production-Grade Example with **Griptape Agent Integration Example**

In this example, we will create a **Griptape** agent by inheriting from the Swarms `Agent` class and implementing the `run` method.

### **Griptape Integration Steps**:

1. **Inherit from Swarms Agent**: Inherit from the `SwarmsAgent` class.
2. **Create Griptape Agent**: Initialize the **Griptape** agent inside your class and provide it with the necessary tools.
3. **Override the `run()` method**: Implement logic to process a task string and execute the Griptape agent.

## **Griptape Example Code**:

```python
from swarms import (
    Agent as SwarmsAgent,
)  # Import the base Agent class from Swarms
from griptape.structures import Agent as GriptapeAgent
from griptape.tools import (
    WebScraperTool,
    FileManagerTool,
    PromptSummaryTool,
)

# Create a custom agent class that inherits from SwarmsAgent
class GriptapeSwarmsAgent(SwarmsAgent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, system_prompt: str: str, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(agent_name=name, system_prompt=system_prompt)
        # Initialize the Griptape agent with its tools
        self.agent = GriptapeAgent(
            input="Load {{ args[0] }}, summarize it, and store it in a file called {{ args[1] }}.",
            tools=[
                WebScraperTool(off_prompt=True),
                PromptSummaryTool(off_prompt=True),
                FileManagerTool(),
            ],
            *args,
            **kwargs,
        )

    # Override the run method to take a task and execute it using the Griptape agent
    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Extract URL and filename from task
        url, filename = task.split(",")  # Example task string: "https://example.com, output.txt"
        # Execute the Griptape agent
        result = self.agent.run(url.strip(), filename.strip())
        # Return the final result as a string
        return str(result)


# Example usage:
griptape_swarms_agent = GriptapeSwarmsAgent()
output = griptape_swarms_agent.run("https://griptape.ai, griptape.txt")
print(output)
```


---

## Best Practices

1. **Test Extensively:**
   Validate your agent with various task inputs to ensure it performs as expected under different conditions.

# Reasoning Agents Overview


Reasoning agents are sophisticated agents that employ advanced cognitive strategies to improve problem-solving performance beyond standard language model capabilities. Unlike traditional prompt-based approaches, reasoning agents implement structured methodologies that enable them to think more systematically, self-reflect, collaborate, and iteratively refine their responses.

These agents are inspired by cognitive science and human reasoning processes, incorporating techniques such as:

- **Multi-step reasoning**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable components

- **Self-reflection**: Evaluating and critiquing their own outputs

- **Iterative refinement**: Progressively improving solutions through multiple iterations

- **Collaborative thinking**: Using multiple reasoning pathways or agent perspectives

- **Memory integration**: Learning from past experiences and building knowledge over time

- **Meta-cognitive awareness**: Understanding their own thinking processes and limitations

# ReasoningDuo

The ReasoningDuo class implements a dual-agent reasoning system that combines a reasoning agent and a main agent to provide well-thought-out responses to complex tasks. This architecture enables more robust and reliable outputs by separating the reasoning process from the final response generation.


## Class Overview

### Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| model_name | str | "reasoning-agent-01" | Name identifier for the reasoning agent |
| description | str | "A highly intelligent..." | Description of the reasoning agent's capabilities |
| model_names | list[str] | ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"] | Model names for reasoning and main agents |
| system_prompt | str | "You are a helpful..." | System prompt for the main agent |

### Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| run | task: str | str | Processes a single task through both agents |
| batched_run | tasks: List[str] | List[str] | Processes multiple tasks sequentially |



## Quick Start

```python
from swarms.agents.reasoning_duo import ReasoningDuo

# Initialize the ReasoningDuo
duo = ReasoningDuo(
    model_name="reasoning-agent-01",
    model_names=["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"]
)

# Run a single task
result = duo.run("Explain the concept of gravitational waves")

# Run multiple tasks
tasks = [
    "Calculate compound interest for $1000 over 5 years",
    "Explain quantum entanglement"
]
results = duo.batched_run(tasks)
```

## Examples

### 1. Mathematical Analysis

```python
duo = ReasoningDuo()

# Complex mathematical problem
math_task = """
Solve the following differential equation:
dy/dx + 2y = x^2, y(0) = 1
"""

solution = duo.run(math_task)
```

### 2. Physics Problem

```python
# Quantum mechanics problem
physics_task = """
Calculate the wavelength of an electron with kinetic energy of 50 eV 
using the de Broglie relationship.
"""

result = duo.run(physics_task)
```

### 3. Financial Analysis

```python
# Complex financial analysis
finance_task = """
Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project with:
- Initial investment: $100,000
- Annual cash flows: $25,000 for 5 years
- Discount rate: 8%
"""

analysis = duo.run(finance_task)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Agent Behavior

You can customize both agents by modifying their initialization parameters:

```python
duo = ReasoningDuo(
    model_name="custom-reasoning-agent",
    description="Specialized financial analysis agent",
    model_names=["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"],
    system_prompt="You are a financial expert AI assistant..."
)
```

### Batch Processing with Progress Tracking

```python
tasks = [
    "Analyze market trends for tech stocks",
    "Calculate risk metrics for a portfolio",
    "Forecast revenue growth"
]

# Process multiple tasks with logging
results = duo.batched_run(tasks)
```

## Implementation Details

The ReasoningDuo uses a two-stage process:

1. **Reasoning Stage**: The reasoning agent analyzes the task and develops a structured approach
2. **Execution Stage**: The main agent uses the reasoning output to generate the final response

### Internal Architecture

```
Task Input → Reasoning Agent → Structured Analysis → Main Agent → Final Output
```

## Best Practices

1. **Task Formulation**
   - Be specific and clear in task descriptions
   - Include relevant context and constraints
   - Break complex problems into smaller subtasks

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use batched_run for multiple related tasks
   - Monitor agent outputs for consistency
   - Adjust model parameters based on task complexity

## Error Handling

The ReasoningDuo includes built-in logging using the `loguru` library:

```python
from loguru import logger

# Logs are automatically generated for each task
logger.info("Task processing started")
```

## Limitations

- Processing time may vary based on task complexity
- Model response quality depends on input clarity
- Resource usage scales with batch size

## Example Script

For a runnable demonstration, see the [reasoning_duo_batched.py](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/examples/models/reasoning_duo_batched.py) example.

|-----------|------|-------------|
| `task` | `str` | The original task |
| `response` | `str` | The generated response |
| `evaluation` | `str` | The evaluation feedback |

### refine

Refines the original response based on evaluation and reflection.

```python
refined_response = agent.refine(
    task: str,
    original_response: str,
    evaluation: str,
    reflection: str
) -> str
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `task` | `str` | The original task |
| `original_response` | `str` | The original response |
| `evaluation` | `str` | The evaluation feedback |
| `reflection` | `str` | The self-reflection |

### step

Processes a single task through one iteration of the Reflexion process.

```python
result = agent.step(
    task: str,
    iteration: int = 0,
    previous_response: str = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `task` | `str` | The task to process |
| `iteration` | `int` | Current iteration number |
| `previous_response` | `str` | Response from previous iteration |

Returns a dictionary containing:
- `task`: The original task
- `response`: The generated response
- `evaluation`: The evaluation feedback
- `reflection`: The self-reflection
- `score`: Numerical score
- `iteration`: Current iteration number

### run

Executes the Reflexion process for a list of tasks.

```python
results = agent.run(
    tasks: List[str],
    include_intermediates: bool = False
) -> List[Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `tasks` | `List[str]` | List of tasks to process |
| `include_intermediates` | `bool` | Whether to include intermediate iterations in results |

Returns:
- If `include_intermediates=False`: List of final responses
- If `include_intermediates=True`: List of complete iteration histories

## Example Usage

```python
from swarms.agents import ReflexionAgent

# Initialize the Reflexion Agent
agent = ReflexionAgent(
    agent_name="reflexion-agent",
    model_name="openai/o1",
    max_loops=3
)

# Example tasks
tasks = [
    "Explain quantum computing to a beginner.",
    "Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key."
]

# Run the agent
results = agent.run(tasks)

# Print results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"\nTask {i+1}: {tasks[i]}")
    print(f"Response: {result}")
```

## Memory System

The ReflexionAgent includes a sophisticated memory system (`ReflexionMemory`) that maintains both short-term and long-term memories of past experiences, reflections, and feedback. This system helps the agent learn from past interactions and improve its responses over time.

### Memory Features
- Short-term memory for recent interactions
- Long-term memory for important reflections and patterns
- Automatic memory management with capacity limits
- Relevance-based memory retrieval
- Similarity-based deduplication

## Best Practices

1. **Task Clarity**: Provide clear, specific tasks to get the best results
2. **Iteration Count**: Adjust `max_loops` based on task complexity (more complex tasks may benefit from more iterations)
3. **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage and adjust `memory_capacity` as needed
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model based on your specific use case and requirements
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling when using the agent in production

# :material-code-json: Agentic Structured Outputs

!!! abstract "Overview"
    Structured outputs help ensure that your agents return data in a consistent, predictable format that can be easily parsed and processed by your application. This is particularly useful when building complex applications that require standardized data handling.

## :material-file-document-outline: Schema Definition

Structured outputs are defined using JSON Schema format. Here's the basic structure:

=== "Basic Schema"

    ```python title="Basic Tool Schema"
    tools = [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "function_name",
                "description": "Description of what the function does",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        # Define your parameters here
                    },
                    "required": [
                        # List required parameters
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

=== "Advanced Schema"

    ```python title="Advanced Tool Schema with Multiple Parameters"
    tools = [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "advanced_function",
                "description": "Advanced function with multiple parameter types",
                "parameters": {

                            "description": "A numeric parameter"
                        },
                        "boolean_param": {
                            "type": "boolean",
                            "description": "A boolean parameter"
                        },
                        "array_param": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {"type": "string"},
                            "description": "An array of strings"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["text_param", "number_param"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

### :material-format-list-bulleted-type: Parameter Types

## 1. Introduction to the Swarms Framework

The swarms framework is a powerful and flexible system designed to facilitate the creation, management, and coordination of multiple AI agents. It provides a standardized interface for working with various agent types, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different agent libraries while maintaining a consistent programming model.

At its core, the swarms framework is built around the concept of a parent `Agent` class, which serves as a foundation for creating custom agents and integrating third-party agent libraries. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: By wrapping different agent implementations with a common interface, developers can work with a unified API across various agent types.
2. **Extensibility**: The framework makes it easy to add new agent types or customize existing ones without affecting the overall system architecture.
3. **Interoperability**: Agents from different libraries can communicate and collaborate seamlessly within the swarms ecosystem.
4. **Scalability**: The standardized approach allows for easier scaling of agent-based systems, from simple single-agent applications to complex multi-agent swarms.

## 2. The Need for Wrappers

As the field of AI and agent-based systems continues to grow, numerous libraries and frameworks have emerged, each with its own strengths and specialized features. While this diversity offers developers a wide range of tools to choose from, it also presents challenges in terms of integration and interoperability.

This is where the concept of wrappers becomes crucial. By creating wrappers around different agent libraries, we can:

1. **Unify interfaces**: Standardize the way we interact with agents, regardless of their underlying implementation.
2. **Simplify integration**: Make it easier to incorporate new agent libraries into existing projects.
3. **Enable composition**: Allow for the creation of complex agent systems that leverage the strengths of multiple libraries.
4. **Facilitate maintenance**: Centralize the management of agent-related code and reduce the impact of library-specific changes.

In the context of the swarms framework, wrappers take the form of custom classes that inherit from the parent `Agent` class. These wrapper classes encapsulate the functionality of specific agent libraries while exposing a consistent interface that aligns with the swarms framework.

## 3. Building Custom Agents with Swarms

To illustrate the process of building custom agents using the swarms framework, let's start with a basic example of creating a custom agent class:

```python
from swarms import Agent

class MyCustomAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Custom initialization logic

    def custom_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Implement custom logic here
        pass

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        # Customize the run method
        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)
        # Additional custom logic
        return response
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental structure of a custom agent class within the swarms framework. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Inheritance**: The class inherits from the `Agent` parent class, ensuring it adheres to the swarms framework's interface.

2. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method calls the parent class's initializer and can include additional custom initialization logic.

3. **Custom methods**: You can add any number of custom methods to extend the agent's functionality.

4. **Run method**: The `run` method is a key component of the agent interface. By overriding this method, you can customize how the agent processes tasks while still leveraging the parent class's functionality.

To create more sophisticated custom agents, you can expand on this basic structure by adding features such as:

- **State management**: Implement methods to manage the agent's internal state.
- **Communication protocols**: Define how the agent interacts with other agents in the swarm.
- **Learning capabilities**: Incorporate machine learning models or adaptive behaviors.
- **Specialized task handling**: Create methods for dealing with specific types of tasks or domains.

By leveraging these custom agent classes, developers can create highly specialized and adaptive agents tailored to their specific use cases while still benefiting from the standardized interface provided by the swarms framework.

## 4. Integrating Third-Party Agent Libraries

One of the key strengths of the swarms framework is its ability to integrate with various third-party agent libraries. In this section, we'll explore how to create wrappers for popular agent libraries, including Griptape, Langchain, CrewAI, and Autogen.

### Griptape Integration

Griptape is a powerful library for building AI agents with a focus on composability and tool use. Let's create a wrapper for a Griptape agent:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

from griptape.structures import Agent as GriptapeAgent
from griptape.tools import FileManager, TaskMemoryClient, WebScraper

from swarms import Agent


class GriptapeAgentWrapper(Agent):
    """
    A wrapper class for the GriptapeAgent from the griptape library.
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, tools: Optional[List] = None, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Initialize the GriptapeAgentWrapper.

        Parameters:
        - name: The name of the agent.
        - tools: A list of tools to be used by the agent. If not provided, default tools will be used.
        - *args, **kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to the parent class constructor.
        """
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.name = name
        self.tools = tools or [
            WebScraper(off_prompt=True),
            TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=True),
            FileManager()
        ]
        self.griptape_agent = GriptapeAgent(
            input=f"I am {name}, an AI assistant. How can I help you?",
            tools=self.tools
        )

    def run(self, task: str, *args, **kwargs) -> str:
        """
        Run a task using the GriptapeAgent.

        Parameters:
        - task: The task to be performed by the agent.

        Returns:
        - The response from the GriptapeAgent as a string.
        """
        response = self.griptape_agent.run(task, *args, **kwargs)
        return str(response)

    def add_tool(self, tool) -> None:
        """
        Add a tool to the agent.

        Parameters:
        - tool: The tool to be added.
        """
        self.tools.append(tool)
        self.griptape_agent = GriptapeAgent(
            input=f"I am {self.name}, an AI assistant. How can I help you?",
            tools=self.tools
        )

# Usage example
griptape_wrapper = GriptapeAgentWrapper("GriptapeAssistant")
result = griptape_wrapper.run("Load https://example.com, summarize it, and store it in a file called example_summary.txt.")
print(result)

```

This wrapper encapsulates the functionality of a Griptape agent while exposing it through the swarms framework's interface. It allows for easy customization of tools and provides a simple way to execute tasks using the Griptape agent.

### Langchain Integration

Langchain is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models. Here's an example of how we can create a wrapper for a Langchain agent:

langchain_wrapper = LangchainAgentWrapper("LangchainAssistant", tools)
result = langchain_wrapper.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(result)
```

This wrapper integrates a Langchain agent into the swarms framework, allowing for easy use of Langchain's powerful features such as tool use and multi-step reasoning.

### CrewAI Integration

CrewAI is a library focused on creating and managing teams of AI agents. Let's create a wrapper for a CrewAI agent:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from crewai import Agent as CrewAIAgent
from crewai import Task, Crew, Process

class CrewAIAgentWrapper(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, role, goal, backstory, tools=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.name = name
        self.crewai_agent = CrewAIAgent(
            role=role,
            goal=goal,
            backstory=backstory,
            verbose=True,
            allow_delegation=False,
            tools=tools or []
        )

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        crew_task = Task(
            description=task,
            agent=self.crewai_agent
        )
        crew = Crew(
            agents=[self.crewai_agent],
            tasks=[crew_task],
            process=Process.sequential
        )
        result = crew.kickoff()
        return result

# Usage example
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

search_tool = SerperDevTool()

crewai_wrapper = CrewAIAgentWrapper(
    "ResearchAnalyst",
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science',
    backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
    Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
    You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.""",
    tools=[search_tool]
)

result = crewai_wrapper.run("Analyze the latest trends in quantum computing and summarize the key findings.")
print(result)
```

This wrapper allows us to use CrewAI agents within the swarms framework, leveraging CrewAI's focus on role-based agents and collaborative task execution.

### Autogen Integration

Autogen is a framework for building conversational AI agents. Here's how we can create a wrapper for an Autogen agent:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from autogen import ConversableAgent

class AutogenAgentWrapper(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, llm_config, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.name = name
        self.autogen_agent = ConversableAgent(
            name=name,
            llm_config=llm_config,
            code_execution_config=False,
            function_map=None,
            human_input_mode="NEVER"
        )

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        messages = [{"content": task, "role": "user"}]
        response = self.autogen_agent.generate_reply(messages)
        return response

# Usage example
import os

llm_config = {
    "config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]
}

autogen_wrapper = AutogenAgentWrapper("AutogenAssistant", llm_config)
result = autogen_wrapper.run("Tell me a joke about programming.")
print(result)
```

This wrapper integrates Autogen's ConversableAgent into the swarms framework, allowing for easy use of Autogen's conversational AI capabilities.

By creating these wrappers, we can seamlessly integrate agents from various libraries into the swarms framework, allowing for a unified approach to agent management and task execution.

## 5. Advanced Agent Handling Techniques

As you build more complex systems using the swarms framework and integrated agent libraries, you'll need to employ advanced techniques for agent handling. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation

Implement a factory pattern to create agents dynamically based on task requirements:

```python
class AgentFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_agent(agent_type, *args, **kwargs):
        if agent_type == "griptape":
            return GriptapeAgentWrapper(*args, **kwargs)
        elif agent_type == "langchain":
            return LangchainAgentWrapper(*args, **kwargs)
        elif agent_type == "crewai":
            return CrewAIAgentWrapper(*args, **kwargs)
        elif agent_type == "autogen":
            return AutogenAgentWrapper(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown agent type: {agent_type}")

# Usage
agent = AgentFactory.create_agent("griptape", "DynamicGriptapeAgent")
```


### 2. Agent Pooling

Implement an agent pool to manage and reuse agents efficiently:

```python
from queue import Queue

class AgentPool:
    def __init__(self, pool_size=5):
        self.pool = Queue(maxsize=pool_size)
        self.pool_size = pool_size

    def get_agent(self, agent_type, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.pool.empty():
            return self.pool.get()
        else:
            return AgentFactory.create_agent(agent_type, *args, **kwargs)

    def release_agent(self, agent):
        if self.pool.qsize() < self.pool_size:
            self.pool.put(agent)

# Usage
pool = AgentPool()
agent = pool.get_agent("langchain", "PooledLangchainAgent")
result = agent.run("Perform a task")
pool.release_agent(agent)
```

### 3. Agent Composition

Create composite agents that combine the capabilities of multiple agent types:

```python
class CompositeAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, agents):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.agents = agents

    def run(self, task):
        results = []
        for agent in self.agents:
            results.append(agent.run(task))
        return self.aggregate_results(results)

    def aggregate_results(self, results):
        # Implement your own logic to combine results
        return "\n".join(results)

# Usage
griptape_agent = GriptapeAgentWrapper("GriptapeComponent")
langchain_agent = LangchainAgentWrapper("LangchainComponent", [])
composite_agent = CompositeAgent("CompositeAssistant", [griptape_agent, langchain_agent])
result = composite_agent.run("Analyze the pros and cons of quantum computing")
```

### 4. Agent Specialization

Create specialized agents for specific domains or tasks:

```python
class DataAnalysisAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, analysis_tools):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.analysis_tools = analysis_tools

    def run(self, data):
        results = {}
        for tool in self.analysis_tools:
            results[tool.name] = tool.analyze(data)
        return results

# Usage
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

class AnalysisTool:
    def __init__(self, name, func):
        self.name = name
        self.func = func

    def analyze(self, data):
        return self.func(data)

tools = [
    AnalysisTool("Descriptive Stats", lambda data: data.describe()),
    AnalysisTool("Correlation", lambda data: data.corr()),
    AnalysisTool("PCA", lambda data: PCA().fit_transform(StandardScaler().fit_transform(data)))
]

data_agent = DataAnalysisAgent("DataAnalyst", tools)
df = pd.read_csv("sample_data.csv")
analysis_results = data_agent.run(df)
```

### 5. Agent Monitoring and Logging

Implement a monitoring system to track agent performance and log their activities:

```python
import logging
from functools import wraps

def log_agent_activity(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
        logging.info(f"Agent {self.name} started task: {args[0]}")
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        logging.info(f"Agent {self.name} completed task. Result length: {len(str(result))}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MonitoredAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.name = name

    @log_agent_activity
    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        return super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)

# Usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
monitored_agent = MonitoredAgent("MonitoredGriptapeAgent")
result = monitored_agent.run("Summarize the latest AI research papers")
```
Additionally the Agent class now includes built-in logging functionality and the ability to switch between JSON and string output. 

To switch between JSON and string output:
- Use `output_type="str"` for string output (default)
- Use `output_type="json"` for JSON output

The `output_type` parameter determines the format of the final result returned by the `run` method. When set to "str", it returns a string representation of the agent's response. When set to "json", it returns a JSON object containing detailed information about the agent's run, including all steps and metadata.

## 6. Best Practices for Custom Agent Development

When developing custom agents using the swarms framework, consider the following best practices:

1. **Modular Design**: Design your agents with modularity in mind. Break down complex functionality into smaller, reusable components.

2. **Consistent Interfaces**: Maintain consistent interfaces across your custom agents to ensure interoperability within the swarms framework.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and graceful degradation in your agents to ensure system stability.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize your agents for performance, especially when dealing with resource-intensive tasks or large-scale deployments.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Develop comprehensive test suites for your custom agents to ensure their reliability and correctness.

6. **Documentation**: Provide clear and detailed documentation for your custom agents, including their capabilities, limitations, and usage examples.

7. **Versioning**: Implement proper versioning for your custom agents to manage updates and maintain backwards compatibility.

8. **Security Considerations**: Implement security best practices, especially when dealing with sensitive data or integrating with external services.

Here's an example that incorporates some of these best practices:

```python
import logging
from typing import Dict, Any
from swarms import Agent

class SecureCustomAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, name: str, api_key: str, version: str = "1.0.0", *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.name = name
        self._api_key = api_key  # Store sensitive data securely
        self.version = version
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(f"{self.__class__.__name__}.{self.name}")

    def run(self, task: str, *args, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            self.logger.info(f"Agent {self.name} (v{self.version}) starting task: {task}")
            result = self._process_task(task)
            self.logger.info(f"Agent {self.name} completed task successfully")
            return {"status": "success", "result": result}
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error in agent {self.name}: {str(e)}")
            return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}

    def _process_task(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Implement the core logic of your agent here
        # This is a placeholder implementation
        return f"Processed task: {task}"

    @property
    def api_key(self) -> str:
        # Provide a secure way to access the API key
        return self._api_key

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"<{self.__class__.__name__} name='{self.name}' version='{self.version}'>"

# Usage
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
secure_agent = SecureCustomAgent("SecureAgent", api_key="your-api-key-here")
result = secure_agent.run("Perform a secure operation")
print(result)
```

This example demonstrates several best practices:
- Modular design with separate methods for initialization and task processing
- Consistent interface adhering to the swarms framework
- Error handling and logging
- Secure storage of sensitive data (API key)
- Version tracking
- Type hinting for improved code readability and maintainability
- Informative string representation of the agent

## 7. Future Directions and Challenges

As the field of AI and agent-based systems continues to evolve, the swarms framework and its ecosystem of integrated agent libraries will face new opportunities and challenges. Some potential future directions and areas of focus include:

1. **Enhanced Interoperability**: Developing more sophisticated protocols for agent communication and collaboration across different libraries and frameworks.

2. **Scalability**: Improving the framework's ability to handle large-scale swarms of agents, potentially leveraging distributed computing techniques.

3. **Adaptive Learning**: Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques to allow agents to adapt and improve their performance over time.

4. **Ethical AI**: Integrating ethical considerations and safeguards into the agent development process to ensure responsible AI deployment.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Exploring new paradigms for human-AI interaction and collaboration within the swarms framework.

6. **Domain-Specific Optimizations**: Developing specialized agent types and tools for specific industries or problem domains.

7. **Explainability and Transparency**: Improving the ability to understand and explain agent decision-making processes.

8. **Security and Privacy**: Enhancing the framework's security features to protect against potential vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy.

As these areas develop, developers working with the swarms framework will need to stay informed about new advancements and be prepared to adapt their agent implementations accordingly.

## Functionality and Usage

The `ToolAgent` class provides a structured way to perform tasks using a model and tokenizer. It initializes with essential parameters and attributes, and the `run` method facilitates the execution of the specified task.

### Initialization

The initialization of a `ToolAgent` involves specifying its name, description, model, tokenizer, JSON schema, maximum number of tokens, optional parsing function, and optional large language model.

```python
agent = ToolAgent(
    name="My Tool Agent",
    description="A tool agent for specific tasks",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=json_schema,
    max_number_tokens=1000,
    parsing_function=my_parsing_function,
    llm=my_llm
)
```

### Running a Task

To execute a task using the `ToolAgent`, the `run` method is called with the task description and any additional arguments or keyword arguments.

```python
result = agent.run("Generate a person's information based on the given schema.")
print(result)
```

### Detailed Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from swarms import ToolAgent

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-12b")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-12b")

json_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "age": {"type": "number"},
        "is_student": {"type": "boolean"},
        "courses": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"}
        }
    }
}

task = "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
agent = ToolAgent(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, json_schema=json_schema)
generated_data = agent.run(task)

print(generated_data)
```

#### Example 2: Using a Parsing Function

```python
def parse_output(output):
    # Custom parsing logic
    return output

agent = ToolAgent(
    name="Parsed Tool Agent",
    description="A tool agent with a parsing function",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=json_schema,
    parsing_function=parse_output
)

task = "Generate a person's information with custom parsing:"
parsed_data = agent.run(task)

print(parsed_data)
```

#### Example 3: Specifying Maximum Number of Tokens

```python
agent = ToolAgent(
    name="Token Limited Tool Agent",
    description="A tool agent with a token limit",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=json_schema,
    max_number_tokens=200
)

task = "Generate a concise person's information:"
limited_data = agent.run(task)

print(limited_data)
```

--------------------------------------------------

# File: swarms\changelog\5_8_1.md

# Swarms 5.8.1 Feature Documentation

## 1. Enhanced Command Line Interface (CLI)

### 1.1 Integrated Onboarding Process

```bash
$ swarms onboarding
```

### 1.2 Run Agents Command

```bash
$ swarms run-agents --yaml-file agents.yaml
```

This command allows users to execute multiple agents defined in a YAML file. Here's the process:

1. The command reads the specified YAML file (`agents.yaml` in this case).
2. It parses the YAML content, extracting the configuration for each agent.
3. For each agent defined in the YAML:
   - It creates an instance of the agent with the specified parameters.
   - It sets up the agent's environment (model, temperature, max tokens, etc.).
   - It assigns the given task to the agent.
   - It executes the agent, respecting parameters like `max_loops`, `autosave`, and `verbose`.
4. The results from all agents are collected and presented to the user.

The YAML file structure allows users to define multiple agents with different configurations, making it easy to run complex, multi-agent tasks from the command line.

### 1.3 Generate Prompt Feature

```bash
$ swarms generate-prompt --prompt "Create a marketing strategy for a new product launch"
```

This feature leverages Swarms' language model to generate expanded or refined prompts:

1. The command takes the user's input prompt as a starting point.
2. It likely sends this prompt to a pre-configured language model (possibly GPT-4 or a similar model).
3. The model then generates an expanded or more detailed version of the prompt.
4. The generated prompt is returned to the user, possibly with options to further refine or save it.

This feature can help users create more effective prompts for their agents or other AI tasks.

## 2. New Prompt Management System

### 2.1 Prompt Class

The new `Prompt` class provides a robust system for managing and versioning prompts:

```python
from swarms import Prompt

marketing_prompt = Prompt(content="Initial marketing strategy draft", autosave=True)

print(marketing_prompt.get_prompt())
```

Key features of the `Prompt` class:

1. **Initialization**: The class is initialized with initial content and an `autosave` option.

2. **Editing**:
   ```python
   marketing_prompt.edit_prompt("Updated marketing strategy with social media focus")
   ```
   This method updates the prompt content and, if `autosave` is True, automatically saves the new version.

3. **Retrieval**:
   ```python
   current_content = marketing_prompt.get_prompt()
   ```
   This method returns the current content of the prompt.

4. **Version History**:
   ```python
   print(f"Edit history: {marketing_prompt.edit_history}")
   ```
   The class maintains a history of edits, allowing users to track changes over time.

5. **Rollback**:
   ```python
   marketing_prompt.rollback(1)
   ```
   This feature allows users to revert to a previous version of the prompt.

6. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   The class includes logic to prevent duplicate edits, raising a `ValueError` if an attempt is made to save the same content twice in a row.

This system provides a powerful way to manage prompts, especially for complex projects where prompt engineering and iteration are crucial.

## 3. Upcoming Features Preview

### 3.1 Enhanced Agent Execution Capabilities

The preview code demonstrates planned enhancements for agent execution:

```python
from swarms import Agent, ExecutionEnvironment

my_agent = Agent(name="data_processor")

cpu_env = ExecutionEnvironment(type="cpu", cores=4)
my_agent.run(environment=cpu_env)

gpu_env = ExecutionEnvironment(type="gpu", device_id=0)
my_agent.run(environment=gpu_env)

fractional_env = ExecutionEnvironment(type="fractional", cpu_fraction=0.5, gpu_fraction=0.3)
my_agent.run(environment=fractional_env)
```

This upcoming feature will allow for more fine-grained control over the execution environment:

1. **CPU Execution**: Users can specify the number of CPU cores to use.
2. **GPU Execution**: Allows selection of a specific GPU device.
3. **Fractionalized Execution**: Enables partial allocation of CPU and GPU resources.

These features will provide users with greater flexibility in resource allocation, potentially improving performance and allowing for more efficient use of available hardware.

# Choosing the Right Swarm for Your Business Problem

Depending on the complexity and nature of your problem, different swarm configurations can be more effective in achieving optimal performance. This guide provides a detailed explanation of when to use each swarm type, including their strengths and potential drawbacks.

## Swarm Types Overview

- **MajorityVoting**: A swarm structure where agents vote on an outcome, and the majority decision is taken as the final result.
- **AgentRearrange**: Provides the foundation for both sequential and parallel swarms.
- **RoundRobin**: Agents take turns handling tasks in a cyclic manner.
- **Mixture of Agents**: A heterogeneous swarm where agents with different capabilities are combined.
- **GraphWorkflow**: Agents collaborate in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) format.
- **GroupChat**: Agents engage in a chat-like interaction to reach decisions.
- **AgentRegistry**: A centralized registry where agents are stored, retrieved, and invoked.
- **SpreadsheetSwarm**: A swarm designed to manage tasks at scale, tracking agent outputs in a structured format (e.g., CSV files).

---

## MajorityVoting Swarm

### Use-Case
MajorityVoting is ideal for scenarios where accuracy is paramount, and the decision must be determined from multiple perspectives. For instance, choosing the best marketing strategy where various marketing agents vote on the highest predicted performance.

### Advantages
- Ensures robustness in decision-making by leveraging multiple agents.
- Helps eliminate outliers or faulty agent decisions.

### Warnings
!!! warning
    Majority voting can be slow if too many agents are involved. Ensure that your swarm size is manageable for real-time decision-making.

---

## AgentRearrange (Sequential and Parallel)

### Sequential Swarm Use-Case
For linear workflows where each task depends on the outcome of the previous task, such as processing legal documents step by step through a series of checks and validations.

### Parallel Swarm Use-Case
For tasks that can be executed concurrently, such as batch processing customer data in marketing campaigns. Parallel swarms can significantly reduce processing time by dividing tasks across multiple agents.

### Notes
!!! note
    Sequential swarms are slower but ensure strict task dependencies are respected. Parallel swarms are faster but require careful management of task interdependencies.

---

## RoundRobin Swarm

### Use-Case
For balanced task distribution where agents need to handle tasks evenly. An example would be assigning customer support tickets to agents in a cyclic manner, ensuring no single agent is overloaded.

### Advantages
- Fair and even distribution of tasks.
- Simple and effective for balanced workloads.

### Warnings
!!! warning
    Round-robin may not be the best choice when some agents are more competent than others, as it can assign tasks equally regardless of agent performance.

---

## Mixture of Agents

### Use-Case
Ideal for complex problems that require diverse skills. For example, a financial forecasting problem where some agents specialize in stock data, while others handle economic factors.

### Notes
!!! note
    A mixture of agents is highly flexible and can adapt to various problem domains. However, be mindful of coordination overhead.

---

## GraphWorkflow Swarm

### Use-Case
This swarm structure is suited for tasks that can be broken down into a series of dependencies but are not strictly linear, such as an AI-driven software development pipeline where one agent handles front-end development while another handles back-end concurrently.

### Advantages
- Provides flexibility for managing dependencies.
- Agents can work on different parts of the problem simultaneously.

### Warnings
!!! warning
    GraphWorkflow requires clear definition of task dependencies, or it can lead to execution issues and delays.

---

## GroupChat Swarm

### Use-Case
For real-time collaborative decision-making. For instance, agents could participate in group chat for negotiating contracts, each contributing their expertise and adjusting responses based on the collective discussion.

### Advantages
- Facilitates highly interactive problem-solving.
- Ideal for dynamic and unstructured problems.

### Warnings
!!! warning
    High communication overhead between agents may slow down decision-making in large swarms.

---

## AgentRegistry Swarm

### Use-Case

### 1.3 Importance of Documentation

Comprehensive documentation helps new developers understand the purpose and functionality of code modules.

```python
def fetch_user_profile(user_id: str) -> UserProfile:
    """
    Fetches the user profile from the database.

    Args:
        user_id (str): The unique identifier of the user.

    Returns:
        UserProfile: An object containing user profile data.
    """
    # Function implementation
```

### 1.4 Consistent Naming Conventions

Consistent naming reduces confusion and makes the code self-explanatory.

- **Functions:** Should be verbs (e.g., `calculate_total`).

# The Limits of Individual Agents

![Reliable Agents](docs/assets/img/reliabilitythrough.png)


Individual agents have pushed the boundaries of what machines can learn and accomplish. However, despite their impressive capabilities, these agents face inherent limitations that can hinder their effectiveness in complex, real-world applications. This blog explores the critical constraints of individual agents, such as context window limits, hallucination, single-task threading, and lack of collaboration, and illustrates how multi-agent collaboration can address these limitations. In short,

- Context Window Limits
- Single Task Execution
- Hallucination
- No collaboration



#### Context Window Limits

One of the most significant constraints of individual agents, particularly in the domain of language models, is the context window limit. This limitation refers to the maximum amount of information an agent can consider at any given time. For instance, many language models can only process a fixed number of tokens (words or characters) in a single inference, restricting their ability to understand and generate responses based on longer texts. This limitation can lead to a lack of coherence in longer compositions and an inability to maintain context in extended conversations or documents.

#### Hallucination

Hallucination in AI refers to the phenomenon where an agent generates information that is not grounded in the input data or real-world facts. This can manifest as making up facts, entities, or events that do not exist or are incorrect. Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content, particularly in critical applications such as news generation, academic research, and legal advice.

#### Single Task Threading

Individual agents are often designed to excel at specific tasks, leveraging their architecture and training data to optimize performance in a narrowly defined domain. However, this specialization can also be a drawback, as it limits the agent's ability to multitask or adapt to tasks that fall outside its primary domain. Single-task threading means an agent may excel in language translation but struggle with image recognition or vice versa, necessitating the deployment of multiple specialized agents for comprehensive AI solutions.

#### Lack of Collaboration

Traditional AI agents operate in isolation, processing inputs and generating outputs independently. This isolation limits their ability to leverage diverse perspectives, share knowledge, or build upon the insights of other agents. In complex problem-solving scenarios, where multiple facets of a problem need to be addressed simultaneously, this lack of collaboration can lead to suboptimal solutions or an inability to tackle multifaceted challenges effectively.

# The Elegant yet Simple Solution

- ## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Recognizing the limitations of individual agents, researchers and practitioners have explored the potential of multi-agent collaboration as a means to transcend these constraints. Multi-agent systems comprise several agents that can interact, communicate, and collaborate to achieve common goals or solve complex problems. This collaborative approach offers several advantages:

#### Overcoming Context Window Limits

By dividing a large task among multiple agents, each focusing on different segments of the problem, multi-agent systems can effectively overcome the context window limits of individual agents. For instance, in processing a long document, different agents could be responsible for understanding and analyzing different sections, pooling their insights to generate a coherent understanding of the entire text.

#### Mitigating Hallucination

Through collaboration, agents can cross-verify facts and information, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. If one agent generates a piece of information, other agents can provide checks and balances, verifying the accuracy against known data or through consensus mechanisms.

#### Enhancing Multitasking Capabilities

Multi-agent systems can tackle tasks that require a diverse set of skills by leveraging the specialization of individual agents. For example, in a complex project that involves both natural language processing and image analysis, one agent specialized in text can collaborate with another specialized in visual data, enabling a comprehensive approach to the task.

#### Facilitating Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

Multi-agent collaboration inherently encourages the sharing of knowledge and insights, allowing agents to learn from each other and improve their collective performance. This can be particularly powerful in scenarios where iterative learning and adaptation are crucial, such as dynamic environments or tasks that evolve over time.

### Conclusion

While individual AI agents have made remarkable strides in various domains, their inherent limitations necessitate innovative approaches to unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence. Multi-agent collaboration emerges as a compelling solution, offering a pathway to transcend individual constraints through collective intelligence. By harnessing the power of collaborative AI, we can address more complex, multifaceted problems, paving the way for more versatile, efficient, and effective AI systems in the future.

The Swarms Framework addresses this limitation by introducing a layer of coordination and collaboration among agents. Through specialized coordination agents and communication protocols, the framework enables agents to share information, divide tasks, and synchronize their actions. This collaborative approach not only increases efficiency but also enables the emergence of collective intelligence, where the combined capabilities of multiple agents surpass the sum of their individual abilities.

### Limitation 5: Cost Inefficiencies

Running large AI models or orchestrating multiple agents can be computationally expensive, particularly in enterprise environments where scalability and cost-effectiveness are critical considerations. Inefficient resource utilization or redundant computations can quickly escalate costs, making widespread adoption of AI-driven automation financially prohibitive.

The Swarms Framework tackles this limitation by optimizing resource allocation and workload distribution among agents. By intelligently assigning tasks to the most appropriate agents and leveraging agent specialization, the framework minimizes redundant computations and improves overall resource utilization. Additionally, the framework can dynamically scale agent instances based on demand, ensuring that computational resources are allocated efficiently and costs are minimized.

Different agents can bring varied perspectives, knowledge bases, and problem-solving approaches to a task. This diversity is crucial in complex problem-solving scenarios where a single approach might not be sufficient. Cognitive diversity enhances creativity, leading to innovative solutions and the ability to tackle a broader range of problems.

#### 2. **Specialization and Expertise**

In many cases, tasks are too complex for a single agent to handle efficiently. By dividing the task among multiple specialized agents, each can focus on a segment where it excels, thereby increasing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the solution. This approach leverages the expertise of individual agents to achieve superior performance in tasks that require multifaceted knowledge and skills.

#### 3. **Scalability and Flexibility**

Multi-agent systems can more easily scale to handle large-scale or evolving tasks. Adding more agents to the system can increase its capacity or capabilities, allowing it to adapt to larger workloads or new types of tasks. This scalability is essential in dynamic environments where the demand and nature of tasks can change rapidly.

#### 4. **Robustness and Redundancy**

Collaboration among multiple agents enhances the system's robustness by introducing redundancy. If one agent fails or encounters an error, others can compensate, ensuring the system remains operational. This redundancy is critical in mission-critical applications where failure is not an option.

### Overcoming Expenses with API Bills and Hosting

Deploying multiple agents, especially when relying on cloud-based services or APIs, can incur significant costs. Here are strategies to manage and reduce these expenses:

#### 1. **Optimize Agent Efficiency**

Before scaling up the number of agents, ensure each agent operates as efficiently as possible. This can involve refining algorithms, reducing unnecessary API calls, and optimizing data processing to minimize computational requirements and, consequently, the associated costs.

#### 2. **Use Open Source and Self-Hosted Solutions**

Where possible, leverage open-source models and technologies that can be self-hosted. While there is an initial investment in setting up the infrastructure, over time, self-hosting can significantly reduce costs related to API calls and reliance on third-party services.

#### 3. **Implement Intelligent Caching**

Caching results for frequently asked questions or common tasks can drastically reduce the need for repeated computations or API calls. Intelligent caching systems can determine what information to store and for how long, optimizing the balance between fresh data and computational savings.

#### 4. **Dynamic Scaling and Load Balancing**

Use cloud services that offer dynamic scaling and load balancing to adjust the resources allocated based on the current demand. This ensures you're not paying for idle resources during low-usage periods while still being able to handle high demand when necessary.

#### 5. **Collaborative Cost-Sharing Models**

In scenarios where multiple stakeholders benefit from the multi-agent system, consider implementing a cost-sharing model. This approach distributes the financial burden among the users or beneficiaries, making it more sustainable.

#### 6. **Monitor and Analyze Costs**

Regularly monitor and analyze your usage and associated costs to identify potential savings. Many cloud providers offer tools to track and forecast expenses, helping you to adjust your usage patterns and configurations to minimize costs without sacrificing performance.

### Conclusion

The collaboration of multiple agents in AI systems presents a robust solution to the complexity, specialization, scalability, and robustness challenges inherent in single-agent approaches. While the associated costs can be significant, strategic optimization, leveraging open-source technologies, intelligent caching, dynamic resource management, collaborative cost-sharing, and diligent monitoring can mitigate these expenses. By adopting these strategies, organizations can harness the power of multi-agent systems to tackle complex problems more effectively and efficiently, ensuring the sustainable deployment of these advanced technologies.

# Multi-Agent Architectures

### What is a Multi-Agent Architecture?

A multi-agent architecture refers to a group of more than two agents working collaboratively to achieve a common goal. These agents can be software entities, such as LLMs that interact with each other to perform complex tasks. The concept of multi-agent architectures is inspired by how humans communicate and work together in teams, organizations, and communities, where individual contributions combine to create sophisticated collaborative problem-solving capabilities.

### How Multi-Agent Architectures Facilitate Communication

Multi-agent architectures are designed to establish and manage communication between agents within a system. These architectures define how agents interact, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Here are some key aspects of multi-agent architectures:

1. **Hierarchical Communication**: In hierarchical architectures, communication flows from higher-level agents to lower-level agents. Higher-level agents act as coordinators, distributing tasks and aggregating results. This structure is efficient for tasks that require top-down control and decision-making.

2. **Concurrent Communication**: In concurrent architectures, agents operate independently and simultaneously on different tasks. This architecture is suitable for tasks that can be processed concurrently without dependencies, allowing for faster execution and scalability.

3. **Sequential Communication**: Sequential architectures process tasks in a linear order, where each agent's output becomes the input for the next agent. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled in the correct sequence, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.

4. **Mesh Communication**: In mesh architectures, agents are fully connected, allowing any agent to communicate with any other agent. This setup provides high flexibility and redundancy, making it ideal for complex systems requiring dynamic interactions.

5. **Federated Communication**: Federated architectures involve multiple independent systems that collaborate by sharing information and results. Each system operates autonomously but can contribute to a larger task, enabling distributed problem-solving across different nodes.

Multi-agent architectures leverage these communication patterns to ensure that agents work together efficiently, adapting to the specific requirements of the task at hand. By defining clear communication protocols and interaction models, multi-agent architectures enable the seamless orchestration of multiple agents, leading to enhanced performance and problem-solving capabilities.

## Architectural Patterns

### Hierarchical Architecture

**Overview:**
Organizes agents in a tree-like structure. Higher-level agents delegate tasks to lower-level agents, which can further divide tasks among themselves. This structure allows for efficient task distribution and scalability.

**Use Cases:**

- Complex decision-making processes where tasks can be broken down into subtasks

- Multi-stage workflows such as data processing pipelines or hierarchical reinforcement learning

graph TD
    A[Root Agent] --> B1[Sub-Agent 1]
    A --> B2[Sub-Agent 2]
    B1 --> C1[Sub-Agent 1.1]
    B1 --> C2[Sub-Agent 1.2]
    B2 --> C3[Sub-Agent 2.1]
    B2 --> C4[Sub-Agent 2.2]
```

---

### Agent Rearrange

**Overview:**
A dynamic architecture where agents rearrange themselves based on task requirements and environmental conditions. Agents can adapt their roles, positions, and relationships to optimize performance for different scenarios.

**Use Cases:**
- Adaptive manufacturing lines that reconfigure based on product requirements

- Dynamic sales territory realignment based on market conditions

- Flexible healthcare staffing that adjusts to patient needs

    A[Task Requirements] --> B[Configuration Analyzer]
    B --> C[Optimization Engine]
    
    C --> D[Agent Pool]
    D --> E[Agent 1]
    D --> F[Agent 2]
    D --> G[Agent 3]
    D --> H[Agent N]
    
    C --> I[Rearrangement Logic]
    I --> J[New Configuration]
    J --> K[Role Assignment]

    L --> M[Performance Monitor]
    M --> N{Optimization Needed?}
    N -->|Yes| C
    N -->|No| O[Continue Execution]
```

---

### Concurrent Architecture

**Overview:**
Multiple agents operate independently and simultaneously on different tasks. Each agent works on its own task without dependencies on the others.

**Use Cases:**
- Tasks that can be processed independently, such as parallel data analysis

- Large-scale simulations where multiple scenarios are run simultaneously

    B1 --> C1[Output 1]
    B2 --> C2[Output 2]
    B3 --> C3[Output 3]
    B4 --> C4[Output 4]
```

---

### Sequential Architecture

**Overview:**
Processes tasks in a linear sequence. Each agent completes its task before passing the result to the next agent in the chain. Ensures orderly processing and is useful when tasks have dependencies.

**Use Cases:**

- Workflows where each step depends on the previous one, such as assembly lines or sequential data processing

- Scenarios requiring strict order of operations

    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker2.json",
)

# Orchestrate the agents in sequence
agents = [director, worker1, worker2]
flow = "Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)

# Run the workflow
output = agent_system.run(
    "Create a format to express and communicate swarms of LLMs in a structured manner for YouTube"
)
print(output)
```

#### 1. Basic Agent Flow:

**Maximizing Enterprise Automation: Overcoming the Limitations of Individual AI Agents Through Multi-Agent Collaboration**


In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, enterprises are constantly seeking innovative solutions to enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and maintain a competitive edge. Automation has emerged as a critical strategy for achieving these objectives, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role. AI agents, particularly those powered by advanced machine learning models, have shown immense potential in automating a variety of tasks. However, individual AI agents come with inherent limitations that hinder their ability to fully automate complex enterprise operations at scale.

This essay dives into the specific limitations of individual AI agents—context window limits, hallucination, single-task execution, lack of collaboration, lack of accuracy, and slow processing speed—and explores how multi-agent collaboration can overcome these challenges. By tailoring our discussion to the needs of enterprises aiming to automate operations at scale, we highlight practical strategies and frameworks that can be adopted to unlock the full potential of AI-driven automation.

---

### Part 1: The Limitations of Individual AI Agents

Despite significant advancements, individual AI agents face several obstacles that limit their effectiveness in enterprise automation. Understanding these limitations is crucial for organizations aiming to implement AI solutions that are both efficient and scalable.

#### 1. Context Window Limits

**Explanation**

AI agents, especially those based on language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4, operate within a fixed context window. This means they can only process and consider a limited amount of information (tokens) at a time. In practical terms, this restricts the agent's ability to handle large documents, long conversations, or complex datasets that exceed their context window.

**Impact on Enterprises**

For enterprises, this limitation poses significant challenges. Business operations often involve processing extensive documents such as legal contracts, technical manuals, or large datasets. An AI agent with a limited context window may miss crucial information located outside its immediate context, leading to incomplete analyses or erroneous conclusions.


```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Context Window Limit"
        Input[Large Document]
        Agent[AI Agent]
        Output[Partial Understanding]
        Input -- Truncated Data --> Agent
        Agent -- Generates --> Output
    end
```

*An AI agent processes only a portion of a large document due to context window limits, resulting in partial understanding.*

#### 2. Hallucination

**Explanation**

Hallucination refers to the tendency of AI agents to produce outputs that are not grounded in the input data or reality. They may generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical information, especially when uncertain or when the input data is ambiguous.

**Impact on Enterprises**

In enterprise settings, hallucinations can lead to misinformation, poor decision-making, and a lack of trust in AI systems. For instance, if an AI agent generates incorrect financial forecasts or misinterprets regulatory requirements, the consequences could be financially damaging and legally problematic.


```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Ambiguous Data]
    Agent[AI Agent]
    Output[Incorrect Information]
    Input --> Agent
    Agent --> Output
```

*An AI agent generates incorrect information (hallucination) when processing ambiguous data.*

#### 3. Single Task Execution

**Explanation**

Many AI agents are designed to excel at a specific task or a narrow set of functions. They lack the flexibility to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or adapt to new tasks without significant reconfiguration or retraining.

**Impact on Enterprises**

Enterprises require systems that can handle a variety of tasks, often concurrently. Relying on single-task agents necessitates deploying multiple separate agents, which can lead to integration challenges, increased complexity, and higher maintenance costs.


```mermaid
graph LR
    TaskA[Task A] --> AgentA[Agent A]
    TaskB[Task B] --> AgentB[Agent B]
    AgentA --> OutputA[Result A]
    AgentB --> OutputB[Result B]
```

*Separate agents handle different tasks independently, lacking integration.*

#### 4. Lack of Collaboration

**Explanation**

Individual AI agents typically operate in isolation, without the ability to communicate or collaborate with other agents. This siloed operation prevents them from sharing insights, learning from each other, or coordinating actions to achieve a common goal.

**Impact on Enterprises**

Complex enterprise operations often require coordinated efforts across different functions and departments. The inability of AI agents to collaborate limits their effectiveness in such environments, leading to disjointed processes and suboptimal outcomes.


```mermaid
graph LR
    Agent1[Agent 1]
    Agent2[Agent 2]
    Agent3[Agent 3]
    Agent1 -->|No Communication| Agent2
    Agent2 -->|No Communication| Agent3
```

*Agents operate without collaboration, resulting in isolated efforts.*

#### 5. Lack of Accuracy

**Explanation**

AI agents may produce inaccurate results due to limitations in their training data, algorithms, or inability to fully understand complex inputs. Factors such as data bias, overfitting, or lack of domain-specific knowledge contribute to this inaccuracy.

**Impact on Enterprises**

Inaccurate outputs can have serious ramifications for businesses, including flawed strategic decisions, customer dissatisfaction, and compliance risks. High accuracy is essential for tasks like financial analysis, customer service, and regulatory compliance.


```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Complex Data]
    Agent[AI Agent]
    Output[Inaccurate Result]
    Input --> Agent
    Agent --> Output
```

*An AI agent produces an inaccurate result when handling complex data.*

#### 6. Slow Processing Speed

**Explanation**

Some AI agents require significant computational resources and time to process data and generate outputs. Factors like model complexity, inefficient algorithms, or hardware limitations can contribute to slow processing speeds.

**Impact on Enterprises**

Slow processing impedes real-time decision-making and responsiveness. In fast-paced business environments, delays can lead to missed opportunities, reduced productivity, and competitive disadvantages.


```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Data]
    Agent[AI Agent]
    Delay[Processing Delay]
    Output[Delayed Response]
    Input --> Agent
    Agent --> Delay
    Delay --> Output
```

*An AI agent's slow processing leads to delayed responses.*

To address the challenges posed by individual AI agents, enterprises can adopt a multi-agent collaboration approach. By orchestrating multiple agents with complementary skills and functionalities, organizations can enhance performance, accuracy, and scalability in their automation efforts.

#### 1. Extending Context Window Through Distributed Processing

**Solution**

By dividing large inputs into smaller segments, multiple agents can process different parts simultaneously. A coordinating agent can then aggregate the results to form a comprehensive understanding.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Document Analysis:** For lengthy legal contracts, agents can each analyze specific sections, and a master agent can compile insights and ensure consistency.
- **Customer Interaction History:** In customer service, agents can handle different segments of a customer's history to provide personalized support.

    Input[Large Document]
    Splitter[Splitter Agent]
    A1[Agent 1]
    A2[Agent 2]
    A3[Agent 3]
    Aggregator[Aggregator Agent]
    Output[Comprehensive Analysis]
    Input --> Splitter
    Splitter --> A1
    Splitter --> A2
    Splitter --> A3
    A1 --> Aggregator
    A2 --> Aggregator
    A3 --> Aggregator
    Aggregator --> Output
```

*Multiple agents process segments of a large document, and results are aggregated.*

#### 2. Reducing Hallucination Through Cross-Verification

**Solution**

Agents can verify each other's outputs by cross-referencing information and flagging inconsistencies. Implementing consensus mechanisms ensures that only accurate information is accepted.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Data Validation:** In data entry automation, one agent inputs data while another validates it against source documents.
- **Decision Support Systems:** Multiple agents evaluate options and agree on recommendations, reducing the risk of incorrect advice.


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent's Output]
    V1[Verifier Agent 1]
    V2[Verifier Agent 2]
    Consensus[Consensus Mechanism]
    Output[Validated Output]
    A --> V1
    A --> V2
    V1 & V2 --> Consensus
    Consensus --> Output
```

*Agents verify outputs through cross-verification and consensus.*

#### 3. Enhancing Multi-Tasking Through Specialized Agents

**Solution**

Deploy specialized agents for different tasks and enable them to work concurrently. An orchestrator agent manages task allocation and workflow integration.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Automated Workflows:** In supply chain management, one agent handles inventory analysis, another manages logistics, and a third forecasts demand.
- **IT Operations:** In IT automation, separate agents manage network monitoring, security scanning, and system updates.


```mermaid
graph LR
    Task[Complex Task]
    Orchestrator[Orchestrator Agent]
    AgentA[Specialist Agent A]
    AgentB[Specialist Agent B]
    AgentC[Specialist Agent C]
    Output[Integrated Solution]
    Task --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator --> AgentA
    Orchestrator --> AgentB
    Orchestrator --> AgentC
    AgentA & AgentB & AgentC --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator --> Output
```

*Specialized agents handle different tasks under the management of an orchestrator agent.*

#### 4. Facilitating Collaboration Through Communication Protocols

**Solution**

Implement communication protocols that allow agents to share information, request assistance, and coordinate actions. This fosters a collaborative environment where agents complement each other's capabilities.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Customer Service:** Chatbots and virtual assistants share customer data to provide seamless support across channels.
- **Project Management:** Agents managing different aspects of a project (scheduling, resource allocation, risk assessment) coordinate to keep the project on track.


```mermaid
graph LR
    Agent1[Agent 1]
    Agent2[Agent 2]
    Agent3[Agent 3]
    Agent1 <--> Agent2
    Agent2 <--> Agent3
    Agent3 <--> Agent1
    Output[Collaborative Outcome]
```

*Agents communicate and collaborate to achieve a common goal.*

#### 5. Improving Accuracy Through Ensemble Learning

**Solution**

Use ensemble methods where multiple agents provide predictions or analyses, and a meta-agent combines these to produce a more accurate result.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Risk Assessment:** Different agents assess risks from various perspectives (financial, operational, compliance), and their insights are combined.
- **Market Analysis:** Agents analyze market trends, customer behavior, and competitor actions, leading to a comprehensive market strategy.


```mermaid
graph TD
    AgentA[Agent A Output]
    AgentB[Agent B Output]
    AgentC[Agent C Output]
    MetaAgent[Meta-Agent]
    Output[Enhanced Accuracy]
    AgentA --> MetaAgent
    AgentB --> MetaAgent
    AgentC --> MetaAgent
    MetaAgent --> Output
```

*Meta-agent combines outputs from multiple agents to improve accuracy.*

#### 6. Increasing Processing Speed Through Parallelization

**Solution**

By distributing workloads among multiple agents operating in parallel, processing times are significantly reduced, enabling real-time responses.

**Implementation in Enterprises**

- **Data Processing:** Large datasets are partitioned and processed simultaneously by different agents.
- **Customer Requests:** Multiple customer inquiries are handled at once by separate agents, improving response times.


```mermaid
graph LR
    Data[Large Dataset]
    Agent1[Agent 1]
    Agent2[Agent 2]
    Agent3[Agent 3]
    Output[Processed Data]
    Data --> Agent1
    Data --> Agent2
    Data --> Agent3
    Agent1 & Agent2 & Agent3 --> Output
```

*Parallel processing by agents leads to faster completion times.*

    task="what is in the image?",
    img=factory_image,
)

print(response)

```

### Supported Image Formats

The vision-enabled agents support various image formats including:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| JPEG/JPG | Standard image format with lossy compression |
| PNG | Lossless format supporting transparency |
| GIF | Animated format (only first frame used) |
| WebP | Modern format with both lossy and lossless compression |

### Best Practices for Vision Tasks

| Best Practice | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Image Quality | Ensure images are clear and well-lit for optimal analysis |
| Image Size | Keep images under 20MB and in supported formats |
| Task Specificity | Provide clear, specific instructions for image analysis |
| Model Selection | Use vision-capable models (e.g., GPT-4V) for image tasks |

# Agent Structured Outputs

This example demonstrates how to use structured outputs with Swarms agents following OpenAI's function calling schema. By defining function schemas, you can specify exactly how agents should structure their responses, making it easier to parse and use the outputs in your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Swarms library

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```

## Environment Variables

```plaintext
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
```

## Understanding Function Schemas

Function schemas in Swarms follow OpenAI's function calling format. Each function schema is defined as a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "function_name",
        "description": "A clear description of what the function does",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                # Define the parameters your function accepts
            },
            "required": ["list", "of", "required", "parameters"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Code Example

Here's an example showing how to use multiple function schemas with a Swarms agent:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT

# Define multiple function schemas
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_stock_price",
            "description": "Retrieve the current stock price and related information for a specified company.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol of the company, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.",
                    },
                    "include_history": {
                        "type": "boolean",
                        "description": "Whether to include historical price data.",
                    },
                    "time": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "format": "date-time",
                        "description": "Optional time for stock data, in ISO 8601 format.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["ticker", "include_history"]
            },
        },
    },
    # Can pass in multiple function schemas as well
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "analyze_company_financials",
            "description": "Analyze key financial metrics and ratios for a company.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol of the company",
                    },
                    "metrics": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": ["PE_ratio", "market_cap", "revenue", "profit_margin"]
                        },
                        "description": "List of financial metrics to analyze"
                    },
                    "timeframe": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["quarterly", "annual", "ttm"],
                        "description": "Timeframe for the analysis"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["ticker", "metrics"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Initialize the agent with multiple function schemas
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    agent_description="Personal finance advisor agent that can fetch stock prices and analyze financials",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    max_loops=1,
    tools_list_dictionary=tools,  # Pass in the list of function schemas
    output_type="final"
)

# Example usage with stock price query
stock_response = agent.run(
    "What is the current stock price for Apple Inc. (AAPL)? Include historical data."
)
print("Stock Price Response:", stock_response)

# Example usage with financial analysis query
analysis_response = agent.run(
    "Analyze Apple's PE ratio and market cap using quarterly data."
)
print("Financial Analysis Response:", analysis_response)
```

## Schema Types and Properties

The function schema supports various parameter types and properties:

| Schema Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Basic Types | `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `object` |
| Format Specifications | `date-time`, `date`, `email`, etc. |
| Enums | Restrict values to a predefined set |
| Required vs Optional Parameters | Specify which parameters must be provided |
| Nested Objects and Arrays | Support for complex data structures |

Example of a more complex schema:

```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "generate_investment_report",
        "description": "Generate a comprehensive investment report",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "portfolio": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "stocks": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {

                                    "entry_price": {"type": "number"}
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        "risk_tolerance": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"]
                        },
                        "time_horizon": {
                            "type": "integer",
                            "minimum": 1,
                            "maximum": 30,
                            "description": "Investment time horizon in years"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["stocks", "risk_tolerance"]
                },
                "report_type": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["summary", "detailed", "risk_analysis"]
                }
            },
            "required": ["portfolio"]
        }
    }
}
```

# Basic Agent Example

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and use tools (callables) with the Swarms framework. Tools are Python functions that your agent can call to perform specific tasks, interact with external services, or process data. We'll show you how to build well-structured tools and integrate them with your agent.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+

- OpenAI API key

- Swarms library

## Building Tools for Your Agent

Tools are functions that your agent can use to interact with external services, process data, or perform specific tasks. Here's a guide on how to build effective tools for your agent:

### Tool Structure Best Practices

1. **Type Hints**: Always use type hints to specify input and output types

2. **Docstrings**: Include comprehensive docstrings with description, args, returns, and examples

3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and return consistent JSON responses

4. **Rate Limiting**: Include rate limiting when dealing with APIs

5. **Input Validation**: Validate input parameters before processing

### Example Tool Template

Here's a template for creating a well-structured tool:

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
import json

def example_tool(param1: str, param2: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """
    Brief description of what the tool does.

    Args:
        param1 (str): Description of first parameter
        param2 (Optional[int]): Description of optional parameter

    Returns:
        str: JSON formatted string containing the result

    Raises:
        ValueError: Description of when this error occurs
        RequestException: Description of when this error occurs

    Example:
        >>> result = example_tool("test", 123)
        >>> print(result)
        {"status": "success", "data": {"key": "value"}}
    """
    try:
        # Input validation
        if not isinstance(param1, str):
            raise ValueError("param1 must be a string")

        # Main logic
        result: Dict[str, Any] = {
            "status": "success",
            "data": {
                "param1": param1,
                "param2": param2
            }
        }

        # Return JSON string
        return json.dumps(result, indent=2)

    except ValueError as e:
        return json.dumps({"error": f"Validation error: {str(e)}"})
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"error": f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"})
```

### Building API Integration Tools

When building tools that interact with external APIs:

1. **API Client Setup**:

```python
def get_api_data(endpoint: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """
    Generic API data fetcher with proper error handling.

    Args:
        endpoint (str): API endpoint to call
        params (Dict[str, Any]): Query parameters

    Returns:
        str: JSON formatted response
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            endpoint,
            params=params,
            timeout=10
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return json.dumps({"error": f"API error: {str(e)}"})
```



### Data Processing Tools

Example of a tool that processes data:

```python
from typing import List, Dict
import pandas as pd

def process_market_data(prices: List[float], window: int = 14) -> str:
    """
    Calculate technical indicators from price data.

    Args:
        prices (List[float]): List of historical prices
        window (int): Rolling window size for calculations

    Returns:
        str: JSON formatted string with calculated indicators

    Example:
        >>> prices = [100, 101, 99, 102, 98, 103]
        >>> result = process_market_data(prices, window=3)
        >>> print(result)
        {"sma": 101.0, "volatility": 2.1}
    """
    try:
        df = pd.DataFrame({"price": prices})
        
        results: Dict[str, float] = {
            "sma": df["price"].rolling(window).mean().iloc[-1],
            "volatility": df["price"].rolling(window).std().iloc[-1]
        }
        
        return json.dumps(results, indent=2)
        
    except Exception as e:
        return json.dumps({"error": f"Processing error: {str(e)}"})
```

### Adding Tools to Your Agent

Once you've created your tools, add them to your agent like this:

```python
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Your-Agent",
    agent_description="Description of your agent",
    system_prompt="System prompt for your agent",
    tools=[
        example_tool,
        get_api_data,
        rate_limited_api_call,
        process_market_data
    ]
)
```

## Tutorial Steps

1. First, install the latest version of Swarms:

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```

2. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
```

3. Create a new Python file and customize your agent with the following parameters:
   - `agent_name`: A unique identifier for your agent
   
   - `agent_description`: A detailed description of your agent's capabilities
   
   - `system_prompt`: The core instructions that define your agent's behavior
   
   - `model_name`: The GPT model to use
   
   - Additional configuration options for temperature and output format

4. Run the example code below:



```python
import json
import requests
from swarms import Agent
from typing import List
import time


def get_coin_price(coin_id: str, vs_currency: str) -> str:
    """
    Get the current price of a specific cryptocurrency.

    Args:
        coin_id (str): The CoinGecko ID of the cryptocurrency (e.g., 'bitcoin', 'ethereum')
        vs_currency (str, optional): The target currency. Defaults to "usd".

    Returns:
        str: JSON formatted string containing the coin's current price and market data

    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: If the API request fails

    Example:
        >>> result = get_coin_price("bitcoin")
        >>> print(result)
        {"bitcoin": {"usd": 45000, "usd_market_cap": 850000000000, ...}}

        vs_currency (str, optional): The target currency. Defaults to "usd".

    Returns:
        str: JSON formatted string containing top cryptocurrencies with detailed market data

    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: If the API request fails
        ValueError: If limit is not between 1 and 250

    Example:

# Agents as Tools Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a powerful multi-agent system where agents can delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents. This pattern is particularly useful for complex tasks that require different types of expertise or capabilities.

## Overview

The Agents as Tools pattern allows you to:

- Create specialized agents with specific capabilities

- Have agents delegate tasks to other agents

- Chain multiple agents together for complex workflows

- Maintain separation of concerns between different agent roles

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

- Basic understanding of Python programming

- Familiarity with async/await concepts (optional)


## Installation

Install the swarms package using pip:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

## Basic Setup

1. First, set up your environment variables:

```python
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define Your Tools**
   
   - Create functions that will serve as tools for your agents
   
   - Add proper type hints and detailed docstrings
   
   - Include error handling and logging
   
   - Example:
   
   ```python
   def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
       """Detailed description of what the tool does.
       
       Args:
           param: Description of the parameter
           
       Returns:
           Description of the return value
       """
       # Tool implementation
       return result
   ```

2. **Create Specialized Agents**
   
   - Define agents with specific roles and capabilities
   
   - Configure each agent with appropriate settings
   
   - Assign relevant tools to each agent
   
   ```python
   specialized_agent = Agent(
       agent_name="Specialist",
       agent_description="Expert in specific domain",
       system_prompt="Detailed instructions for the agent",
       tools=[tool1, tool2]
   )
   ```

3. **Set Up the Director Agent**
   
   - Create a high-level agent that coordinates other agents
   
   - Give it access to specialized agents as tools
   
   - Define clear delegation rules
   
   ```python
   director = Agent(
       agent_name="Director",
       agent_description="Coordinates other agents",
       tools=[specialized_agent.run]
   )
   ```

4. **Execute Multi-Agent Workflows**
   
   - Start with the director agent
   
   - Let it delegate tasks as needed
   
   - Handle responses and chain results
   
   ```python
   result = director.run("Your high-level task description")
   ```

# Aggregate Multi-Agent Responses

The `aggregate` function allows you to run multiple agents concurrently on the same task and then synthesize their responses using an intelligent aggregator agent. This is useful for getting diverse perspectives on a problem and then combining them into a comprehensive analysis.

## Installation

You can get started by first installing swarms with the following command, or [click here for more detailed installation instructions](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/install/install/):

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
``` 

## Environment Variables

```txt
WORKSPACE_DIR=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
```

## How It Works

1. **Concurrent Execution**: All agents in the `workers` list run the same task simultaneously
2. **Response Collection**: Individual agent responses are collected into a conversation
3. **Intelligent Aggregation**: A specialized aggregator agent analyzes all responses and creates a comprehensive synthesis
4. **Formatted Output**: The final result is returned in the specified format

## Code Example

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.structs.ma_blocks import aggregate


# Create specialized agents for different perspectives
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name="Sector-Financial-Analyst",
        agent_description="Senior financial analyst at BlackRock.",
        system_prompt="You are a financial analyst tasked with optimizing asset allocations for a $50B portfolio. Provide clear, quantitative recommendations for each sector.",
        max_loops=1,
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_tokens=3000,
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="Sector-Risk-Analyst",
        agent_description="Expert risk management analyst.",
        system_prompt="You are a risk analyst responsible for advising on risk allocation within a $50B portfolio. Provide detailed insights on risk exposures for each sector.",
        max_loops=1,
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_tokens=3000,
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="Tech-Sector-Analyst",
        agent_description="Technology sector analyst.",
        system_prompt="You are a tech sector analyst focused on capital and risk allocations. Provide data-backed insights for the tech sector.",
        max_loops=1,
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_tokens=3000,
    ),
]

# Run the aggregate function
result = aggregate(
    workers=agents,
    task="What is the best sector to invest in?",
    type="all",  # Get complete conversation history
    aggregator_model_name="anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
)

print(result)
```

```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Initialize Specialized Agents

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.concurrent_workflow import ConcurrentWorkflow

# Initialize market research agent
market_researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Market-Researcher",
    system_prompt="""You are a market research specialist. Your tasks include:
    1. Analyzing market trends and patterns
    2. Identifying market opportunities and threats
    3. Evaluating competitor strategies
    4. Assessing customer needs and preferences
    5. Providing actionable market insights""",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Initialize financial analyst agent
financial_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst",
    system_prompt="""You are a financial analysis expert. Your responsibilities include:
    1. Analyzing financial statements
    2. Evaluating investment opportunities
    3. Assessing risk factors
    4. Providing financial forecasts

    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Initialize technical analyst agent
technical_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Technical-Analyst",
    system_prompt="""You are a technical analysis specialist. Your focus areas include:
    1. Analyzing price patterns and trends
    2. Evaluating technical indicators
    3. Identifying support and resistance levels
    4. Assessing market momentum
    5. Providing trading recommendations""",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Create list of agents
agents = [market_researcher, financial_analyst, technical_analyst]

# Initialize the concurrent workflow with dashboard
router = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    name="market-analysis-router",
    agents=agents,
    max_loops=1,
    show_dashboard=True,  # Enable the real-time dashboard
)

# Run the workflow
result = router.run(
    "Analyze Tesla (TSLA) stock from market, financial, and technical perspectives"
)
```

## Features

### Real-time Dashboard

The ConcurrentWorkflow includes a powerful real-time dashboard feature that provides comprehensive monitoring and visualization of agent execution. Enable it by setting `show_dashboard=True` during workflow initialization.

#### Dashboard Features

- **Live Status Tracking**: Real-time updates showing each agent's execution status
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual indicators of agent progress and completion
- **Output Streaming**: Live display of agent outputs as they're generated
- **Error Monitoring**: Immediate visibility into any agent failures or errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time and completion statistics
- **Clean Display**: Automatic cleanup and formatting for optimal viewing

#### Dashboard Status Values

- **"pending"**: Agent is queued but not yet started
- **"running"**: Agent is currently executing the task
- **"completed"**: Agent finished successfully with output
- **"error"**: Agent execution failed with error details

#### Dashboard Configuration

```python
# Enable dashboard with custom configuration
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    name="my-workflow",
    agents=agents,
    show_dashboard=True,  # Enable real-time monitoring
    output_type="dict",   # Configure output format
    auto_save=True,       # Auto-save conversation history
)
```

#### Dashboard Behavior

When `show_dashboard=True`:
- Individual agent print outputs are automatically disabled to prevent conflicts
- Dashboard updates every 100ms for smooth real-time streaming
- Initial dashboard shows all agents as "pending"
- Real-time updates show status changes and output previews
- Final dashboard displays complete results summary
- Automatic cleanup of dashboard resources after completion

### Concurrent Execution

- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Uses 95% of available CPU cores for optimal performance
- **True Parallelism**: Agents execute simultaneously, not sequentially
- **Thread Safety**: Safe concurrent access to shared resources
- **Error Isolation**: Individual agent failures don't affect others
- **Resource Management**: Automatic thread lifecycle management

### Output Formatting Options

The workflow supports multiple output aggregation formats:

- **"dict-all-except-first"**: Dictionary with all agent outputs except the first (default)
- **"dict"**: Complete dictionary with all agent outputs keyed by agent name
- **"str"**: Concatenated string of all agent outputs
- **"list"**: List of individual agent outputs in completion order

```python
# Configure output format
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=agents,
    output_type="dict",  # Get complete dictionary of results
    show_dashboard=True
)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Auto Prompt Engineering

Enable automatic prompt optimization for all agents:

```python
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=agents,
    auto_generate_prompts=True,  # Enable automatic prompt engineering
    show_dashboard=True
)
```

#### Conversation History Management

Automatic conversation tracking and persistence:

```python
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=agents,
    auto_save=True,                    # Auto-save conversation history
    metadata_output_path="results.json"  # Custom output file path
)
```

#### Multimodal Support

Support for image inputs across all agents:

```python
# Single image input
result = workflow.run(
    task="Analyze this chart",
    img="financial_chart.png"
)

# Multiple image inputs
result = workflow.run(
    task="Compare these charts",
    imgs=["chart1.png", "chart2.png", "chart3.png"]
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Dashboard Usage

- **Development & Debugging**: Use dashboard for real-time monitoring during development
- **Production**: Consider disabling dashboard for headless execution in production
- **Performance**: Dashboard adds minimal overhead but provides valuable insights
- **Error Handling**: Dashboard immediately shows which agents fail and why

### 2. Agent Configuration

- **Specialization**: Use specialized agents for specific tasks
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for each agent's role
- **Temperature**: Configure temperature based on task requirements
- **System Prompts**: Write clear, specific system prompts for each agent

### 3. Resource Management

- **CPU Utilization**: Workflow automatically uses 95% of available cores
- **Memory**: Monitor conversation history growth in long-running workflows
- **Rate Limits**: Handle API rate limits appropriately for your LLM provider
- **Error Recovery**: Implement fallback mechanisms for failed agents

### 4. Task Design

- **Independence**: Ensure tasks can be processed concurrently without dependencies
- **Granularity**: Break complex tasks into independent subtasks
- **Balance**: Distribute work evenly across agents for optimal performance

## Example Implementations

    result = workflow.run("Complex analysis task")
    
    # Check for errors in results
    for agent_name, output in result.items():
        if output.startswith("Error:"):
            print(f"Agent {agent_name} failed: {output}")
        else:
            print(f"Agent {agent_name} completed successfully")
            
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Workflow execution failed: {str(e)}")
    # Results may still be available for successful agents
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Agent Count**: Use 2+ agents to benefit from concurrent execution
2. **CPU Utilization**: Workflow automatically optimizes for available cores
3. **Dashboard Overhead**: Minimal performance impact for valuable monitoring
4. **Memory Management**: Clear conversation history for very large batch jobs
5. **Error Recovery**: Failed agents don't stop successful ones

## Use Cases

- **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Financial, legal, technical reviews
- **Consensus Building**: Voting systems and decision making
- **Parallel Processing**: Data analysis and batch operations
- **A/B Testing**: Different agent configurations and strategies
- **Redundancy**: Reliability improvements through multiple agents
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Development and debugging workflows

This guide demonstrates how to effectively use the ConcurrentWorkflow architecture with its advanced dashboard feature for parallel processing of complex tasks using multiple specialized agents.

```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Agent Specialization**: Create agents with specific, well-defined expertise areas
2. **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed, actionable task descriptions
3. **Appropriate Loop Count**: Set `max_loops` based on task complexity (1-3 for most tasks)
4. **Verbose Logging**: Enable verbose mode during development for debugging
5. **Context Preservation**: The swarm maintains full conversation history automatically

For more detailed information about the `HierarchicalSwarm` API and advanced usage patterns, see the [main documentation](hierarchical_swarm.md).

## Interactive Groupchat Examples

The Interactive GroupChat is a powerful multi-agent architecture that enables dynamic collaboration between multiple AI agents. This architecture allows agents to communicate with each other, respond to mentions using `@agent_name` syntax, and work together to solve complex tasks through structured conversation flows.

### Architecture Description

The Interactive GroupChat implements a **collaborative swarm architecture** where multiple specialized agents work together in a coordinated manner. Key features include:

- **Mention-based Communication**: Agents can be directed to specific tasks using `@agent_name` syntax
- **Flexible Speaker Functions**: Multiple speaking order strategies (round robin, random, priority-based)
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Agents build upon each other's responses and avoid redundancy
- **Interactive Sessions**: Support for both automated and interactive conversation modes
- **Context Awareness**: Agents maintain conversation history and context

For comprehensive documentation on Interactive GroupChat, visit: [Interactive GroupChat Documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/interactive_groupchat/)

### Step-by-Step Showcase

* **Agent Creation**: Define specialized agents with unique expertise and system prompts
* **GroupChat Initialization**: Create the InteractiveGroupChat structure with desired speaker function
* **Task Definition**: Formulate tasks using `@agent_name` mentions to direct specific agents
* **Execution**: Run the group chat to generate collaborative responses
* **Response Processing**: Handle the coordinated output from multiple agents
* **Iteration**: Chain multiple tasks for complex workflows

## Installation

Install the swarms package using pip:

```bash
pip install -U swarms
```

## Basic Setup

1. First, set up your environment variables:

```python
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"

InteractiveGroupChat Speaker Function Examples

This example demonstrates how to use different speaker functions in the InteractiveGroupChat:
- Round Robin: Agents speak in a fixed order, cycling through the list
- Random: Agents speak in random order
- Priority: Agents speak based on priority weights
- Custom: User-defined speaker functions

The example also shows how agents can mention each other using @agent_name syntax.

# Llama4 Model Integration

!!! info "Prerequisites"
    - Python 3.8 or higher
    - `swarms` library installed
    - Access to Llama4 model
    - Valid environment variables configured

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of integrating Llama4 model for crypto risk analysis:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.utils.vllm_wrapper import VLLM

load_dotenv()
model = VLLM(model_name="meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E")
```

## Available Models

| Model Name | Description | Type |
|------------|-------------|------|
| meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E | Base model with 128 experts | Base |
| meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct | Instruction-tuned version with 128 experts | Instruct |
| meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 | FP8 quantized instruction model | Instruct (Optimized) |
| meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E | Base model with 16 experts | Base |
| meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct | Instruction-tuned version with 16 experts | Instruct |

!!! tip "Model Selection"
    - Choose Instruct models for better performance on instruction-following tasks
    - FP8 models offer better memory efficiency with minimal performance impact
    - Scout models (16E) are lighter but still powerful
    - Maverick models (128E) offer maximum performance but require more resources

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Define Custom System Prompt

```python
CRYPTO_RISK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a cryptocurrency risk analysis expert. Your role is to:

1. Analyze market risks:
   - Volatility assessment
   - Market sentiment analysis
   - Trading volume patterns
   - Price trend evaluation

2. Evaluate technical risks:
   - Network security
   - Protocol vulnerabilities
   - Smart contract risks
   - Technical scalability

3. Consider regulatory risks:
   - Current regulations
   - Potential regulatory changes
   - Compliance requirements
   - Geographic restrictions

4. Assess fundamental risks:
   - Team background
   - Project development status
   - Competition analysis
   - Use case viability

Provide detailed, balanced analysis with both risks and potential mitigations.
Base your analysis on established crypto market principles and current market conditions.
"""
```

### 2. Initialize Agent

```python
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Crypto-Risk-Analysis-Agent",
    agent_description="Agent for analyzing risks in cryptocurrency investments",
    system_prompt=CRYPTO_RISK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT,
    max_loops=1,
    llm=model,
)
```

## Full Code

)

print(
    agent.run(
        "Conduct a risk analysis of the top cryptocurrencies. Think for 2 loops internally"
    )
)
```

!!! warning "Resource Usage"
    The Llama4 model requires significant computational resources. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements.

## FAQ

??? question "What is the purpose of max_loops parameter?"
    The `max_loops` parameter determines how many times the agent will iterate through its thinking process. In this example, it's set to 1 for a single pass analysis.

??? question "Can I use a different model?"
    Yes, you can replace the VLLM wrapper with other compatible models. Just ensure you update the model initialization accordingly.

??? question "How do I customize the system prompt?"
    You can modify the `CRYPTO_RISK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` string to match your specific use case while maintaining the structured format.

!!! note "Best Practices"
    - Always handle API errors gracefully
    - Monitor model performance and resource usage
    - Keep your prompts clear and specific
    - Test thoroughly before production deployment

!!! example "Sample Usage"
    ```python
    response = agent.run(
        "Conduct a risk analysis of the top cryptocurrencies. Think for 2 loops internally"
    )
    print(response)
    ```

# File: swarms\examples\moa_example.md

# Mixture of Agents Example

The Mixture of Agents (MoA) is a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that implements parallel processing with iterative refinement. This approach processes multiple specialized agents simultaneously, concatenates their outputs, and then performs multiple parallel runs to achieve consensus or enhanced results.

## How It Works

1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on the same input
2. **Output Concatenation**: Results from all agents are combined into a unified response
3. **Iterative Refinement**: The process repeats for `n` layers/iterations to improve quality
4. **Consensus Building**: Multiple runs help achieve more reliable and comprehensive outputs

This architecture is particularly effective for complex tasks that benefit from diverse perspectives and iterative improvement, such as financial analysis, risk assessment, and multi-faceted problem solving.

from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Initialize specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="ResearchAgent",
    system_prompt="You are a research specialist...",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1
)

analysis_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="AnalysisAgent",
    system_prompt="You are an analysis expert...",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1
)

summary_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="SummaryAgent",
    system_prompt="You are a summarization specialist...",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1
)

# Create router with sequential workflow
router = SwarmRouter(
    name="ResearchAnalysisRouter",
    description="Process research and analysis tasks",
    agents=[research_agent, analysis_agent, summary_agent],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow,
    max_loops=1,
    verbose=True
)

# Run complex task
try:
    result = router.run(
        "Research and analyze the impact of AI on healthcare, "
        "providing a comprehensive summary of findings."
    )
    print("Task Result:", result)
    
    # Print logs
    for log in router.get_logs():
        print(f"{log.timestamp} - {log.level}: {log.message}")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error processing task: {str(e)}")
```

This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to effectively use the SwarmRouter in various scenarios, making it easier to manage and orchestrate multiple agents for complex tasks.

# Swarms DAO Example

This example demonstrates how to create a swarm of agents to collaborate on a task. The agents are designed to work together to create a comprehensive strategy for a DAO focused on decentralized governance for climate action.

You can customize the agents and their system prompts to fit your specific needs.

## Common Parameters

All swarm architectures accept these base parameters:

- `agents: AgentListType` - List of Agent objects to participate in the swarm
- `tasks: List[str]` - List of tasks to be processed by the agents
- `return_full_history: bool` (optional) - If True, returns conversation history. Defaults to True

Return types are generally `Union[dict, List[str]]`, where:
- If `return_full_history=True`: Returns a dictionary containing the full conversation history
- If `return_full_history=False`: Returns a list of agent responses

## Basic Swarm Patterns

### Circular Swarm
```python
def circular_swarm(agents: AgentListType, tasks: List[str], return_full_history: bool = True)
```

**Information Flow:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Circular Flow
    A1((Agent 1)) --> A2((Agent 2))
    A2 --> A3((Agent 3))
    A3 --> A4((Agent 4))
    A4 --> A1
    end
    Task1[Task 1] --> A1
    Task2[Task 2] --> A2
    Task3[Task 3] --> A3
```

**Best Used When:**

- You need continuous processing of tasks

- Tasks need to be processed by every agent in sequence

- You want predictable, ordered task distribution

**Key Features:**

    S --> R((Receiver))
    R --> Result[Result]
```

**Best Used When:**

- Direct agent communication is needed

- Tasks require back-and-forth interaction

- You need controlled message exchange

### Broadcast Communication
```python
async def broadcast(sender: Agent, agents: AgentListType, task: str) -> None
```

**Information Flow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T[Task] --> S((Sender))
    S --> A1((Agent 1))
    S --> A2((Agent 2))
    S --> A3((Agent 3))
    S --> A4((Agent 4))
```

**Best Used When:**

- Information needs to reach all agents

- Tasks require global coordination

- You need system-wide updates

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Pattern:**
   - Consider your task's natural structure
   - Think about scaling requirements
   - Consider fault tolerance needs

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - More complex patterns have higher overhead
   - Consider communication costs
   - Match pattern to available resources

3. **Error Handling:**
   - All patterns include basic error checking
   - Consider adding additional error handling for production
   - Monitor agent performance and task completion

4. **Scaling:**
   - Different patterns scale differently
   - Consider future growth needs
   - Test with expected maximum load

# Vision Processing Examples

This example demonstrates how to use vision-enabled agents in Swarms to analyze images and process visual information. You'll learn how to work with both OpenAI and Anthropic vision models for various use cases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+

- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4V)

- Anthropic API key (for Claude 3)

- Swarms library

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```

## Environment Variables

```plaintext
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
OPENAI_API_KEY=""  # Required for GPT-4V
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""  # Required for Claude 3
```

## Working with Images

### Supported Image Formats

Vision-enabled agents support various image formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| JPEG/JPG | Standard image format with lossy compression |
| PNG | Lossless format supporting transparency |
| GIF | Animated format (only first frame used) |
| WebP | Modern format with both lossy and lossless compression |

### Image Guidelines

- Maximum file size: 20MB
- Recommended resolution: At least 512x512 pixels
- Image should be clear and well-lit
- Avoid heavily compressed or blurry images

## Examples

### 1. Quality Control with GPT-4V

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from swarms.prompts.logistics import Quality_Control_Agent_Prompt

# Load your image
factory_image = "path/to/your/image.jpg"  # Local file path
# Or use a URL
# factory_image = "https://example.com/image.jpg"

# Initialize quality control agent with GPT-4V
quality_control_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Quality Control Agent",
    agent_description="A quality control agent that analyzes images and provides detailed quality reports.",
    model_name="gpt-4.1-mini",
    system_prompt=Quality_Control_Agent_Prompt,
    multi_modal=True,
    max_loops=1
)

# Run the analysis
response = quality_control_agent.run(
    task="Analyze this image and provide a detailed quality control report",
    img=factory_image
)

print(response)
```

### 2. Visual Analysis with Claude 3

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from swarms.prompts.logistics import Visual_Analysis_Prompt

# Load your image
product_image = "path/to/your/product.jpg"

# Initialize visual analysis agent with Claude 3
visual_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Visual Analyst",
    agent_description="An agent that performs detailed visual analysis of products and scenes.",
    model_name="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    system_prompt=Visual_Analysis_Prompt,
    multi_modal=True,
    max_loops=1
)

# Run the analysis
response = visual_analyst.run(
    task="Provide a comprehensive analysis of this product image",
    img=product_image
)

print(response)
```

### 3. Image Batch Processing

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
import os

def process_image_batch(image_folder, agent):
    """Process multiple images in a folder"""
    results = []

- Add your image path to the run method like: `Agent().run(task=task, img=img)`

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from swarms.prompts.logistics import (
    Quality_Control_Agent_Prompt,
)


# Image for analysis
factory_image = "image.jpg"


def security_analysis(danger_level: str) -> str:
    """
    Analyzes the security danger level and returns an appropriate response.

    Args:
        danger_level (str, optional): The level of danger to analyze.
            Can be "low", "medium", "high", or None. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        str: A string describing the danger level assessment.
            - "No danger level provided" if danger_level is None
            - "No danger" if danger_level is "low"
            - "Medium danger" if danger_level is "medium"
            - "High danger" if danger_level is "high"
            - "Unknown danger level" for any other value

    if danger_level is None:
        return "No danger level provided"

    if danger_level == "low":
        return "No danger"

    if danger_level == "medium":
        return "Medium danger"

    if danger_level == "high":
        return "High danger"

    return "Unknown danger level"


custom_system_prompt = f"""
{Quality_Control_Agent_Prompt}

You have access to tools that can help you with your analysis. When you need to perform a security analysis, you MUST use the security_analysis function with an appropriate danger level (low, medium, or high) based on your observations.

Always use the available tools when they are relevant to the task. If you determine there is any level of danger or security concern, call the security_analysis function with the appropriate danger level.
"""

# Quality control agent
quality_control_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Quality Control Agent",
    agent_description="A quality control agent that analyzes images and provides a detailed report on the quality of the product in the image.",
    # model_name="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",

# An Analysis of Agents

In the Swarms framework, agents are designed to perform tasks autonomously by leveraging large language models (LLMs), various tools, and long-term memory systems. This guide provides an extensive conceptual walkthrough of how an agent operates, detailing the sequence of actions it takes to complete a task and how it utilizes its internal components.

#### Agent Components Overview
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: The core component responsible for understanding and generating natural language.
- **Tools**: External functions and services that the agent can call to perform specific tasks, such as querying databases or interacting with APIs.
- **Long-term Memory**: Systems like ChromaDB or Pinecone that store and retrieve information over extended periods, enabling the agent to remember past interactions and contexts.

#### Agent Workflow
The workflow of an agent can be divided into several stages: task initiation, initial LLM processing, tool usage, memory interaction, and final LLM processing.

##### Stage 1: Task Initiation
- **Input**: The task or query that the agent needs to address.
- **Output**: A structured plan or approach for handling the task.

##### Stage 2: Initial LLM Processing
- **Input**: The task or query.
- **Process**: The LLM interprets the task, understanding the context and requirements.
- **Output**: An initial response or action plan.

##### Stage 3: Tool Usage
- **Input**: The action plan or specific sub-tasks identified by the LLM.
- **Process**: The agent calls various tools to gather information, perform calculations, or interact with external systems.
  - **Function Calling as Tools**: Tools are called as functions with specific inputs and outputs, enabling the agent to perform a wide range of tasks.
- **Output**: Data or results from the tools.

##### Stage 4: Memory Interaction
- **Input**: Intermediate results and context from the tools.
- **Process**: The agent interacts with long-term memory systems to store new information and retrieve relevant past data.
  - **RAG Systems (ChromaDB, Pinecone)**: These systems are used to enhance the agent’s responses by providing relevant historical data and context.
- **Output**: Enhanced context and data for final processing.

##### Stage 5: Final LLM Processing
- **Input**: Comprehensive data and context from the tools and memory systems.
- **Process**: The LLM generates the final response or completes the task using the enriched data.
- **Output**: The final output or action taken by the agent.

```

### Explanation of Each Stage

#### Stage 1: Task Initiation
- **Task**: The agent receives a task or query from an external source (e.g., a user query, a system trigger).
- **Objective**: To understand what needs to be done and prepare an initial approach.

#### Stage 2: Initial LLM Processing
- **Interpretation**: The LLM processes the task to comprehend its context and requirements.
- **Planning**: The LLM generates an initial plan or identifies the sub-tasks required to complete the task.

#### Stage 3: Tool Usage
- **Function Calls**: The agent uses predefined functions (tools) to perform specific actions, such as querying a database or making API calls.
- **Tool Integration**: Each tool is called with specific parameters, and the results are collected for further processing.

#### Stage 4: Memory Interaction
- **Long-term Memory**: Systems like ChromaDB and Pinecone store and retrieve long-term data, providing the agent with historical context and past interactions.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The agent uses RAG systems to enhance the current context with relevant past data, improving the quality and relevance of the final output.

#### Stage 5: Final LLM Processing
- **Enhanced Processing**: The LLM processes the enriched data and context provided by the tools and memory systems.
- **Final Output**: The LLM generates a comprehensive response or completes the task using the enhanced information.

### Conclusion

The Swarms framework's agents are powerful units that combine LLMs, tools, and long-term memory systems to perform complex tasks efficiently. By leveraging function calling for tools and RAG systems like ChromaDB and Pinecone, agents can enhance their capabilities and deliver highly relevant and accurate results. This conceptual guide and walkthrough provide a detailed understanding of how agents operate within the Swarms framework, enabling the development of sophisticated and collaborative AI systems.

8. Conclusion

## 1. Introduction to Code Cleanliness

Code cleanliness refers to the practice of writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Clean code follows consistent conventions and is organized logically, making it easier for developers to collaborate and for new team members to get up to speed quickly.

### Why Clean Code Matters

1. **Readability**: Clean code is easy to read and understand, which reduces the time needed to grasp what the code does.
2. **Maintainability**: Clean code is easier to maintain and modify, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.
3. **Collaboration**: Clean code facilitates collaboration among team members, as everyone can easily understand and follow the codebase.
4. **Debugging**: Clean code makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, leading to more reliable software.

## 2. Importance of Type Annotations

Type annotations in Python provide a way to specify the types of variables, function arguments, and return values. They enhance code readability and help catch type-related errors early in the development process.

### Benefits of Type Annotations

1. **Improved Readability**: Type annotations make it clear what types of values are expected, improving code readability.
2. **Error Detection**: Type annotations help catch type-related errors during development, reducing runtime errors.
3. **Better Tooling**: Many modern IDEs and editors use type annotations to provide better code completion and error checking.

### Example of Type Annotations

```python
from typing import List

def calculate_average(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The average of the numbers.
    """
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

In this example, the `calculate_average` function takes a list of floats as input and returns a float. The type annotations make it clear what types are expected and returned, enhancing readability and maintainability.

## 3. Writing Effective Docstrings

Docstrings are an essential part of writing clean code in Python. They provide inline documentation for modules, classes, methods, and functions. Effective docstrings improve code readability and make it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.

### Benefits of Docstrings

1. **Documentation**: Docstrings serve as inline documentation, making it easier to understand the purpose and usage of code.
2. **Consistency**: Well-written docstrings ensure consistent documentation across the codebase.
3. **Ease of Use**: Docstrings make it easier for developers to use and understand code without having to read through the implementation details.

### Example of Effective Docstrings

```python
def calculate_factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

    Args:
        n (int): The non-negative integer to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial
```

In this example, the docstring clearly explains the purpose of the `calculate_factorial` function, its arguments, return value, and the exception it may raise.

## 4. Structuring Your Code

Proper code structure is crucial for code cleanliness. A well-structured codebase is easier to navigate, understand, and maintain. Here are some best practices for structuring your Python code:

### Organizing Code into Modules and Packages

Organize your code into modules and packages to group related functionality together. This makes it easier to find and manage code.

```python
# project/
# ├── main.py
# ├── utils/
# │   ├── __init__.py
# │   ├── file_utils.py
# │   └── math_utils.py
# └── models/
#     ├── __init__.py
#     ├── user.py
#     └── product.py
```

### Using Functions and Classes

Break down your code into small, reusable functions and classes. This makes your code more modular and easier to test.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        """
        Initializes a new user.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the user.
            age (int): The age of the user.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self) -> str:
        """
        Greets the user.

        Returns:
            str: A greeting message.
        """
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"
```

### Keeping Functions Small

Functions should do one thing and do it well. Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

```python
def save_user(user: User, filename: str) -> None:
    """
    Saves user data to a file.

    Args:
        user (User): The user object to save.
        filename (str): The name of the file to save the user data to.
    """
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"{user.name},{user.age}")
```

## 5. Error Handling and Logging with Loguru

Effective error handling and logging are critical components of clean code. They help you manage and diagnose issues that arise during the execution of your code.

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except` clause.
2. **Provide Meaningful Messages**: When raising exceptions, provide meaningful error messages to help diagnose the issue.
3. **Clean Up Resources**: Use `finally` blocks or context managers to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.

### Example of Error Handling

```python
def divide_numbers(numerator: float, denominator: float) -> float:
    """
    Divides the numerator by the denominator.

    Args:
        numerator (float): The number to be divided.
        denominator (float): The number to divide by.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the division.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the denominator is zero.
    """
    if denominator == 0:
        raise ValueError("The denominator cannot be zero.")
    return numerator / denominator
```

### Logging with Loguru

Loguru is a powerful logging library for Python that makes logging simple and enjoyable. It provides a clean and easy-to-use API for logging messages with different severity levels.

#### Installing Loguru

```bash
pip install loguru
```

#### Basic Usage of Loguru

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```

### Example of Logging in a Function

```python
from loguru import logger

def fetch_data(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches data from a given URL and returns it as a string.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to fetch data from.

    Returns:
        str: The data fetched from the URL.

    Raises:
        requests.exceptions.RequestException: If there is an error with the request.
    """
    try:
        logger.info(f"Fetching data from {url}")
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        logger.info("Data fetched successfully")
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
        raise
```

In this example, Loguru is used to log messages at different severity levels. The `fetch_data` function logs informational messages when fetching data and logs an error message if an exception is raised.

## 6. Refactoring for Clean Code

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It is an essential practice for maintaining clean code. Refactoring helps improve code readability, reduce complexity, and eliminate redundancy.

### Identifying Code Smells

Code smells are indicators of potential issues in the code that may require refactoring. Common code smells include:
1. **Long Methods**: Methods that are too long and do too many things.
2. **Duplicated Code**: Code that is duplicated in multiple places.
3. **Large Classes**: Classes that have too many responsibilities.
4. **Poor Naming**: Variables, functions, or classes with unclear or misleading names.

### Refactoring Techniques

1. **Extract Method**: Break down long methods into smaller, more focused methods.
2. **Rename Variables**: Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
3. **Remove Duplicated Code**: Consolidate duplicated code into a single location.
4. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: Simplify complex conditional expressions for

 better readability.

### Example of Refactoring

Before refactoring:
```python
def process_data(data: List[int]) -> int:
    total = 0
    for value in data:
        if value > 0:
            total += value
    return total
```

After refactoring:
```python
def filter_positive_values(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filters the positive values from the input data.

    Args:
        data (List[int]): The input data.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of positive values.
    """
    return [value for value in data if value > 0]

def sum_values(values: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Sums the values in the input list.

    Args:
        values (List[int]): A list of values to sum.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the values.
    """
    return sum(values)

def process_data(data: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Processes the data by filtering positive values and summing them.

    Args:
        data (List[int]): The input data.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the positive values.
    """
    positive_values = filter_positive_values(data)
    return sum_values(positive_values)
```

In this example, the `process_data` function is refactored into smaller, more focused functions. This improves readability and maintainability.

## 7. Examples of Clean Code

### Example 1: Reading a File

```python
def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Reads the content of a file and returns it as a string.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file to read.

    Returns:
        str: The content of the file.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
        IOError: If there is an error reading the file.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        raise
    except IOError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading file: {file_path}")
        raise
```

### Example 2: Fetching Data from a URL

```python
import requests
from loguru import logger

def fetch_data(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetches data from a given URL and returns it as a string.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to fetch data from.

    Returns:
        str: The data fetched from the URL.

    Raises:
        requests.exceptions.RequestException: If there is an error with the request.
    """
    try:
        logger.info(f"Fetching data from {url}")
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        logger.info("Data fetched successfully")
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
        raise
```

### Example 3: Calculating Factorial

```python
def calculate_factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

    Args:
        n (int): The non-negative integer to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the given number.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial
```

### Directory Breakdown

The directory structure of the `swarms` framework is organized to support its hierarchical architecture:

```sh
swarms/
├── agents/
├── artifacts/
├── marketplace/
├── memory/
├── models/
├── prompts/
├── schemas/
├── structs/
├── telemetry/
├── tools/
├── utils/
└── __init__.py
```

### Summary

The `swarms` framework is designed to facilitate complex multi-agent interactions through a structured and layered approach. By leveraging foundational components like models, tools, and memory, individual agents are empowered to perform specialized tasks. These agents are then coordinated within swarms to achieve collective goals, and swarms are managed within high-level structs to orchestrate sophisticated workflows.

This hierarchical design ensures scalability, flexibility, and robustness, making the `swarms` framework a powerful tool for various applications in AI, data analysis, optimization, and beyond.

### `swarms.__init__`

**Description**:  
This module initializes the Swarms package by concurrently executing the bootup process and activating Sentry for telemetry. It imports various components from other modules within the Swarms package.

**Imports**:
- `concurrent.futures`: A module that provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.

- `swarms.telemetry.bootup`: Contains the `bootup` function for initializing telemetry.

- `swarms.telemetry.sentry_active`: Contains the `activate_sentry` function to enable Sentry for error tracking.

- Other modules from the Swarms package are imported for use, including agents, artifacts, prompts, structs, telemetry, tools, utils, and schemas.


**Concurrent Execution**:
The module uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run the `bootup` and `activate_sentry` functions concurrently.

```python
import concurrent.futures
from swarms.telemetry.bootup import bootup  # noqa: E402, F403
from swarms.telemetry.sentry_active import activate_sentry

# Use ThreadPoolExecutor to run bootup and activate_sentry concurrently
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
    executor.submit(bootup)
    executor.submit(activate_sentry)

from swarms.agents import *  # noqa: E402, F403
from swarms.artifacts import *  # noqa: E402, F403

# How to Run Tests Using Pytest: A Comprehensive Guide

In modern software development, automated testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and functionality of your code. One of the most popular testing frameworks for Python is `pytest`. 

This blog will provide an in-depth look at how to run tests using `pytest`, including testing a single file, multiple files, every file in the test repository, and providing guidelines for contributors to run tests reliably.

## What is Pytest?

`pytest` is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It supports fixtures, parameterized testing, and has a rich plugin architecture. `pytest` is widely used because of its ease of use and powerful features that help streamline the testing process.

## Installation

To get started with `pytest`, you need to install it. You can install `pytest` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

## Writing Your First Test

Before diving into running tests, let’s write a simple test. Create a file named `test_sample.py` with the following content:

```python
def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

def test_subtraction():
    assert 2 - 1 == 1
```

In this example, we have defined two basic tests: `test_addition` and `test_subtraction`.

## Running Tests

### Running a Single Test File

To run a single test file, you can use the `pytest` command followed by the filename. For example, to run the tests in `test_sample.py`, use the following command:

```bash
pytest test_sample.py
```

The output will show the test results, including the number of tests passed, failed, or skipped.

### Running Multiple Test Files

You can also run multiple test files by specifying their filenames separated by a space. For example:

```bash
pytest test_sample.py test_another_sample.py
```

If you have multiple test files in a directory, you can run all of them by specifying the directory name:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Running All Tests in the Repository

To run all tests in the repository, navigate to the root directory of your project and simply run:

```bash
pytest
```

`pytest` will automatically discover and run all the test files that match the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.

### Test Discovery

`pytest` automatically discovers test files and test functions based on their naming conventions. By default, it looks for files that match the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` and functions or methods that start with `test_`.

### Using Markers

`pytest` allows you to use markers to group tests or add metadata to them. Markers can be used to run specific subsets of tests. For example, you can mark a test as `slow` and then run only the slow tests or skip them.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_long_running():
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
    assert True

def test_fast():
    assert True
```

To run only the tests marked as `slow`, use the `-m` option:

```bash
pytest -m slow
```

### Parameterized Tests

`pytest` supports parameterized testing, which allows you to run a test with different sets of input data. This can be done using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", [
    (1, 2, 3),
    (2, 3, 5),
    (3, 5, 8),
])
def test_add(a, b, expected):
    assert a + b == expected
```

In this example, `test_add` will run three times with different sets of input data.

### Fixtures

Fixtures are a powerful feature of `pytest` that allow you to set up some context for your tests. They can be used to provide a fixed baseline upon which tests can reliably and repeatedly execute.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return {"name": "John", "age": 30}

def test_sample_data(sample_data):
    assert sample_data["name"] == "John"
    assert sample_data["age"] == 30
```

Fixtures can be used to share setup and teardown code between tests.

## Advanced Usage

### Running Tests in Parallel

`pytest` can run tests in parallel using the `pytest-xdist` plugin. To install `pytest-xdist`, run:

```bash
pip install pytest-xdist
```

To run tests in parallel, use the `-n` option followed by the number of CPU cores you want to use:

```bash
pytest -n 4
```

### Generating Test Reports

`pytest` can generate detailed test reports. You can use the `--html` option to generate an HTML report:

```bash
pip install pytest-html
pytest --html=report.html
```

This command will generate a file named `report.html` with a detailed report of the test results.

### Code Coverage

You can use the `pytest-cov` plugin to measure code coverage. To install `pytest-cov`, run:

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
```

To generate a coverage report, use the `--cov` option followed by the module name:

```bash
pytest --cov=my_module
```

This command will show the coverage summary in the terminal. You can also generate an HTML report:

```bash
pytest --cov=my_module --cov-report=html
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `htmlcov` directory.

## Best Practices for Writing Tests

1. **Write Clear and Concise Tests**: Each test should focus on a single piece of functionality.
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test function names should clearly describe what they are testing.
3. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other and should run in isolation.
4. **Use Fixtures**: Use fixtures to set up the context for your tests.
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocking to isolate the code under test from external dependencies.

## Running Tests Reliably

For contributors and team members, it’s important to run tests reliably to ensure consistent results. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent testing environment.
   
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install all required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
   
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run Tests Before Pushing**: Ensure all tests pass before pushing code to the repository.

4. **Use Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up CI pipelines to automatically run tests on each commit or pull request.

### Example CI Configuration (GitHub Actions)

Here is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests using `pytest`:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
```

This configuration will run the tests on every push and pull request, ensuring that your codebase remains stable.

## Conclusion

`pytest` is a powerful and flexible testing framework that makes it easy to write and run tests for your Python code. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this blog, you can ensure that your tests are reliable and your codebase is robust. Whether you are testing a single file, multiple files, or the entire repository, `pytest` provides the tools you need to automate and streamline your testing process.

Happy testing!

# Glossary of Terms

**Agent**:  
An LLM (Large Language Model) equipped with tools and memory, operating with a specific objective in a loop. An agent can perform tasks, interact with other agents, and utilize external tools and memory systems to achieve its goals.

**Swarms**:  
A group of more than two agents working together and communicating to accomplish a shared objective. Swarms enable complex, collaborative tasks that leverage the strengths of multiple agents.

**Tool**:  
A Python function that is converted into a function call, allowing agents to perform specific actions or access external resources. Tools enhance the capabilities of agents by providing specialized functionalities.

**Memory System**:  
A system for managing information retrieval and storage, often implemented as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system or a memory vector database. Memory systems enable agents to recall previous interactions, store new information, and improve decision-making based on historical data.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**:  
A type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4, are used as the core computational engine for agents.

**System Prompt**:  
A predefined prompt that sets the context and instructions for an agent's task. The system prompt guides the agent's behavior and response generation.

**Max Loops**:  
The maximum number of iterations an agent will perform to complete its task. This parameter helps control the extent of an agent's processing and ensures tasks are completed efficiently.

**Dashboard**:  
A user interface that provides real-time monitoring and control over the agents and their activities. Dashboards can display agent status, logs, and performance metrics.

**Streaming On**:  
A setting that enables agents to stream their output incrementally, providing real-time feedback as they process tasks. This feature is useful for monitoring progress and making adjustments on the fly.

**Verbose**:  
A setting that controls the level of detail in an agent's output and logging. When verbose mode is enabled, the agent provides more detailed information about its operations and decisions.

**Multi-modal**:  
The capability of an agent to process and integrate multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio. Multi-modal agents can handle more complex tasks that require diverse inputs.

**Autosave**:  
A feature that automatically saves the agent's state and progress at regular intervals. Autosave helps prevent data loss and allows for recovery in case of interruptions.

**Flow**:  
The predefined sequence in which agents in a swarm interact and process tasks. The flow ensures that each agent's output is appropriately passed to the next agent, facilitating coordinated efforts.

**Long Term Memory**:  
A component of the memory system that retains information over extended periods, enabling agents to recall and utilize past interactions and experiences.

**Output Schema**:  
A structured format for the output generated by agents, often defined using data models like Pydantic's BaseModel. Output schemas ensure consistency and clarity in the information produced by agents.

By understanding these terms, you can effectively build and orchestrate agents and swarms, leveraging their capabilities to perform complex, collaborative tasks.

## Dockerfile

Creating a Dockerfile for deploying the `swarms` framework to the cloud involves setting up the necessary environment to run your Python application, ensuring all dependencies are installed, and configuring the container to execute the desired tasks. Here's an example Dockerfile that sets up such an environment:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/swarm_cloud

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get -y install gcc \
    && apt-get clean

# Install Python dependencies
# COPY requirements.txt and pyproject.toml if you're using poetry for dependency management
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install the 'swarms' package, assuming it's available on PyPI
ENV SWARM_API_KEY=your_swarm_api_key_here
ENV OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
RUN pip install swarms

# Copy the rest of the application
COPY . .

# Add entrypoint script if needed
# COPY ./entrypoint.sh .
# RUN chmod +x /usr/src/swarm_cloud/entrypoint.sh

# Expose port if your application has a web interface
# EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable for the swarm to work
# Add Docker CMD or ENTRYPOINT script to run the application
# CMD python your_swarm_startup_script.py
# Or use the entrypoint script if you have one
# ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/src/swarm_cloud/entrypoint.sh"]

# If you're using `CMD` to execute a Python script, make sure it's executable
# RUN chmod +x your_swarm_startup_script.py
```

To build and run this Docker image:

1. Replace `requirements.txt` with your actual requirements file or `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` if you're using Poetry.
2. Replace `your_swarm_startup_script.py` with the script that starts your application.
3. If your application requires an API key or other sensitive data, make sure to set these securely, perhaps using environment variables or secrets management solutions provided by your cloud provider.
4. If you have an entrypoint script, uncomment the `COPY` and `RUN` lines for `entrypoint.sh`.
5. If your application has a web interface, uncomment the `EXPOSE` line and set it to the correct port.

Now, build your Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t swarm-cloud .
```

And run it:

```sh
docker run -d --name my-swarm-app swarm-cloud
```

For deploying to the cloud, you'll need to push your Docker image to a container registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry), then pull it from your cloud environment to run it. Cloud providers often have services specifically for this purpose (like AWS ECS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS). The deployment process will involve:

- Pushing the image to a registry.
- Configuring cloud services to run your image.
- Setting up networking, storage, and other cloud resources.
- Monitoring, logging, and potentially scaling your containers.

Remember to secure sensitive data, use tagged releases for your images, and follow best practices for operating in the cloud.

# Environment Variables

## Overview

Swarms uses environment variables for configuration management and secure credential storage. This approach keeps sensitive information like API keys out of your code and allows for easy configuration changes across different environments.

## Core Environment Variables

### Framework Configuration

=== "Configuration Variables"

    | Variable | Description | Example |
    |----------|-------------|---------|
    | `SWARMS_VERBOSE_GLOBAL` | Controls global logging verbosity | `True` or `False` |
    | `WORKSPACE_DIR` | Defines the workspace directory for agent operations | `agent_workspace` |

### LLM Provider API Keys

=== "OpenAI"
    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
    ```

=== "Anthropic"
    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
    ```

=== "Groq"
    ```bash
    GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
    ```

=== "Google"
    ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
    ```

=== "Hugging Face"
    ```bash

    ```

## Security Best Practices

### Environment File Management

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Never commit `.env` files to version control
3. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:
    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

### API Key Security

!!! warning "Important Security Considerations"
    - Rotate API keys regularly
    - Use different API keys for development and production
    - Never hardcode API keys in your code
    - Limit API key permissions to only what's necessary
    - Monitor API key usage for unusual patterns

### Template Configuration

Create a `.env.example` template without actual values:

```bash
# Required Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
GROQ_API_KEY=""
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"

# Optional Configuration
SWARMS_VERBOSE_GLOBAL="False"
```

### Loading Environment Variables

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Access variables
workspace_dir = os.getenv("WORKSPACE_DIR")
openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Environment Setup Guide

=== "1. Install Dependencies"
    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

=== "2. Create Environment File"
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

=== "3. Configure Variables"
    - Open `.env` in your text editor
    - Add your API keys and configuration
    - Save the file

=== "4. Verify Setup"
    ```python
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()
    assert os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None, "OpenAI API key not found"
    ```

## Environment-Specific Configuration

=== "Development"
    ```bash
    WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
    SWARMS_VERBOSE_GLOBAL="True"
    ```

=== "Production"
    ```bash
    WORKSPACE_DIR="/var/swarms/workspace"
    SWARMS_VERBOSE_GLOBAL="False"
    ```

=== "Testing"
    ```bash
    WORKSPACE_DIR="test_workspace"
    SWARMS_VERBOSE_GLOBAL="True"
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

???+ note "Environment Variables Not Loading"
    - Verify `.env` file exists in project root
    - Confirm `load_dotenv()` is called before accessing variables
    - Check file permissions

???+ note "API Key Issues"
    - Verify key format is correct
    - Ensure key has not expired
    - Check for leading/trailing whitespace

???+ note "Workspace Directory Problems"
    - Confirm directory exists
    - Verify write permissions
    - Check path is absolute when required

## Rust

=== "Cargo install"

    Get started with the Rust implementation of Swarms. [Get started with the docs here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms_rs/overview/)

    ```bash
    cargo add swarms-rs
    ```




--------------------------------------------------

# File: swarms\install\quickstart.md

## Quickstart

**Swarms** is an enterprise-grade, production-ready multi-agent collaboration framework that enables you to orchestrate agents to work collaboratively at scale to automate real-world activities. Follow this quickstart guide to get up and running with Swarms, including setting up your environment, building an agent, and leveraging multi-agent methods.

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.10 or above
- `.env` file with API keys from your providers like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Set an environment variable for your workspace directory:
  ```bash
  WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
  ```

### **Installation**

To install Swarms, run:
```bash
$ pip install -U swarms
```

### **Usage Example: Single Agent**

Here's a simple example of creating a financial analysis agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model. This agent will analyze financial queries like how to set up a ROTH IRA.

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent

# Initialize the agent with GPT-4o-mini model
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="Analyze financial situations and provide advice...",
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True,
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Run your query
out = agent.run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?"
)
print(out)
```

#### **Agent Class**

- **Attributes:**
  - `agent_name`: Name of the agent.
  - `system_prompt`: System-level instruction guiding the agent's behavior.
  - `model_name`: Name of the model to use (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini").
  - `max_loops`: Max iterations for a task.
  - `autosave`: Auto-saves the state after each iteration.
  
- **Methods:**
  - `run(task: str)`: Executes the agent's task.
  - `ingest_docs(doc_path: str)`: Ingests documents into the agent's knowledge base.
  - `filtered_run(task: str)`: Runs agent with a filtered system prompt.

-----

## Creating Agents from YAML


### Step 1: Define Your Agents in a YAML File

The `create_agents_from_yaml` function works by reading agent configurations from a YAML file. Below is an example of what your YAML file (`agents_config.yaml`) should look like this. Example YAML Configuration (`agents_config.yaml`):

```yaml
agents:
  - agent_name: "Financial-Analysis-Agent"
    system_prompt: "You are a financial analysis expert. Analyze market trends and provide investment recommendations."
    model_name: "claude-3-opus-20240229"
    max_loops: 1
    autosave: false
    dashboard: false
    verbose: false
    dynamic_temperature_enabled: false
    user_name: "swarms_corp"
    retry_attempts: 1
    context_length: 200000
    return_step_meta: false
    output_type: "str"
    temperature: 0.1
    max_tokens: 2000
    task: "Analyze tech stocks for 2024 investment strategy. Provide detailed analysis and recommendations."

  - agent_name: "Risk-Analysis-Agent"
    system_prompt: "You are a risk analysis expert. Evaluate investment risks and provide mitigation strategies."
    model_name: "claude-3-opus-20240229"
    max_loops: 1
    autosave: false
    dashboard: false
    verbose: false
    dynamic_temperature_enabled: false
    user_name: "swarms_corp"
    retry_attempts: 1
    context_length: 150000
    return_step_meta: false
    output_type: "str"
    temperature: 0.1
    max_tokens: 2000
    task: "Conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of the top 5 tech companies in 2024. Include risk factors and mitigation strategies."

swarm_architecture:
  name: "Financial Analysis Swarm"
  description: "A swarm for comprehensive financial and risk analysis"
  max_loops: 1
  swarm_type: "SequentialWorkflow"
  task: "Analyze tech stocks and their associated risks for 2024 investment strategy"
  autosave: false
  return_json: true
```

### Key Configuration Fields:
- **agent_name**: Name of the agent.
- **system_prompt**: The system prompt used to guide the agent's behavior.
- **model_name**: The language model to use (e.g., claude-3-opus-20240229).
- **task**: Task for the agent to execute.
- **swarm_architecture**: (Optional) Configuration for swarm behavior.

---

### Step 2: Create the Main Script

Now, create the main Python script that will use the `create_agents_from_yaml` function.

### `main.py`:
```python
from swarms.agents.create_agents_from_yaml import create_agents_from_yaml

# Create agents and get task results
task_results = create_agents_from_yaml(
    yaml_file="agents_config.yaml",
    return_type="run_swarm"
)

print(task_results)
```

### Example Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load agent configurations from `agents_config.yaml`.
2. Create the agents specified in the YAML file.
3. Run the tasks provided for each agent.
4. Output the task results to the console.

---

### Step 3: Customize the Return Type

The `create_agents_from_yaml` function supports multiple return types. You can control what is returned by setting the `return_type` parameter to `"agents"`, `"tasks"`, or `"both"`.

1. **Return Only Agents**
To create agents but not run tasks, set `return_type="agents"`:

```python
agents = create_agents_from_yaml(yaml_file, return_type="agents")
for agent in agents:
    print(f"Agent {agent.agent_name} created.")
```

2. **Return Only Task Results**
If you only care about the task results and not the agent objects, set `return_type="tasks"`:

```python
task_results = create_agents_from_yaml(yaml_file, return_type="tasks")
for result in task_results:
    print(f"Agent {result['agent_name']} executed task '{result['task']}' with output: {result['output']}")
```

3. **Return Both Agents and Task Results**
To return both the list of created agents and task results, use `return_type="both"`:

```python
agents, task_results = create_agents_from_yaml(yaml_file, return_type="both")
# Process agents and tasks separately
```


## Step 4: YAML Structure for Multiple Agents

The YAML file can define any number of agents, each with its own unique configuration. You can scale this setup by adding more agents and tasks to the `agents` list within the YAML file.

```yaml
agents:
  - agent_name: "Agent1"
    # Agent1 config...

  - agent_name: "Agent2"
    # Agent2 config...

  - agent_name: "Agent3"
    # Agent3 config...
```

Each agent will be initialized according to its configuration, and tasks (if provided) will be executed automatically.

---

## Integrating External Agents
Integrating external agents from other agent frameworks is easy with swarms.

Steps:

1. Create a new class that inherits `Agent`
2. Create a `.run(task: str) -> str` method that runs the agent and returns the response. 
3. The new Agent must return a string of the response. But you may add additional methods to save the output to JSON.


### Griptape Example

For example, here's an example on how to create an agent from griptape.

Here's how you can create a custom **Griptape** agent that integrates with the **Swarms** framework by inheriting from the `Agent` class in **Swarms** and overriding the `run(task: str) -> str` method.


```python
from swarms import (
    Agent as SwarmsAgent,
)  # Import the base Agent class from Swarms
from griptape.structures import Agent as GriptapeAgent
from griptape.tools import (
    WebScraperTool,
    FileManagerTool,
    PromptSummaryTool,
)


# Create a custom agent class that inherits from SwarmsAgent
class GriptapeSwarmsAgent(SwarmsAgent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Initialize the Griptape agent with its tools
        self.agent = GriptapeAgent(
            input="Load {{ args[0] }}, summarize it, and store it in a file called {{ args[1] }}.",
            tools=[
                WebScraperTool(off_prompt=True),
                PromptSummaryTool(off_prompt=True),
                FileManagerTool(),
            ],
            *args,
            **kwargs,
            # Add additional settings
        )

    # Override the run method to take a task and execute it using the Griptape agent
    def run(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Extract URL and filename from task (you can modify this parsing based on task structure)
        url, filename = task.split(
            ","
        )  # Example of splitting task string
        # Execute the Griptape agent with the task inputs
        result = self.agent.run(url.strip(), filename.strip())
        # Return the final result as a string
        return str(result)


# Example usage:
griptape_swarms_agent = GriptapeSwarmsAgent()
output = griptape_swarms_agent.run(
    "https://griptape.ai, griptape.txt"
)
print(output)
```

### Key Components:
1. **GriptapeSwarmsAgent**: A custom class that inherits from the `SwarmsAgent` class and integrates the Griptape agent.
2. **run(task: str) -> str**: A method that takes a task string, processes it (e.g., splitting into a URL and filename), and runs the Griptape agent with the provided inputs.
3. **Griptape Tools**: The tools integrated into the Griptape agent (e.g., `WebScraperTool`, `PromptSummaryTool`, `FileManagerTool`) allow for web scraping, summarization, and file management.

You can now easily plug this custom Griptape agent into the **Swarms Framework** and use it to run tasks!





## Overview of Swarm Architectures in the Swarms Framework
---

### 1. **Sequential Workflow**

**Overview**: The `SequentialWorkflow` enables tasks to be executed one after the other. Each agent processes its task and passes the output to the next agent in the sequence.

#### Mermaid Graph:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Task Input] --> B[Blog Generator Agent];
    B --> C[Summarizer Agent];
    C --> D[Task Output];
```

#### Code Example:

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents without importing a specific LLM class
agent1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Blog generator",
    system_prompt="Generate a blog post",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1
)
agent2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Summarizer",
    system_prompt="Summarize the blog post",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1
)

# Create Sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[agent1, agent2], max_loops=1)

# Run workflow
output = workflow.run("Generate a blog post on how swarms of agents can help businesses grow.")
print(output)
```

---

### 2. **Agent Rearrange**

**Overview**: `AgentRearrange` allows the orchestration of agents in both sequential and parallel configurations. The user can define a flexible flow of tasks between agents.

#### Mermaid Graph:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Director Agent] --> B[Worker 1 Agent];
    A --> C[Worker 2 Agent];
    B --> D[Task Completed];
    C --> D[Task Completed];
```

#### Code Example:

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Initialize agents using model_name (no explicit LLM import)
director = Agent(
    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs tasks",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1
)
worker1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker1",
    system_prompt="Generate a transcript",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1
)
worker2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker2",
    system_prompt="Summarize the transcript",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_loops=1
)

# Define the flow and create the rearranged system
flow = "Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=[director, worker1, worker2], flow=flow)

# Run it
output = agent_system.run("Create a YouTube transcript and summary")
print(output)
```



---

### 4. **Mixture of Agents**

**Overview**: `MixtureOfAgents` is a parallelized architecture where agents perform tasks concurrently and then feed their results back into a loop for final aggregation. This is useful for highly parallelizable tasks.

#### Mermaid Graph:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Director Agent] --> B[Accountant 1];
    A --> C[Accountant 2];
    B --> D[Final Aggregation];
    C --> D[Final Aggregation];
```

#### Code Example:

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, MixtureOfAgents

# Initialize agents
director = Agent(agent_name="Director", system_prompt="Directs tasks", llm=OpenAIChat(), max_loops=1)
accountant1 = Agent(agent_name="Accountant1", system_prompt="Prepare financial statements", llm=OpenAIChat(), max_loops=1)
accountant2 = Agent(agent_name="Accountant2", system_prompt="Audit financial records", llm=OpenAIChat(), max_loops=1)

# Create Mixture of Agents swarm
swarm = MixtureOfAgents(name="Mixture of Accountants", agents=[director, accountant1, accountant2], layers=3, final_agent=director)

# Run the swarm
output = swarm.run("Prepare financial statements and audit financial records")
print(output)
```

---

### 5. **Spreadsheet Swarm**

**Overview**: `SpreadSheetSwarm` enables the management of thousands of agents simultaneously, where each agent operates on its own thread. It's ideal for overseeing large-scale agent outputs.

#### Mermaid Graph:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Spreadsheet Swarm] --> B[Twitter Agent];
    A --> C[Instagram Agent];
    A --> D[Facebook Agent];
    A --> E[LinkedIn Agent];
    A --> F[Email Agent];
```

#### Code Example:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.spreadsheet_swarm import SpreadSheetSwarm

# Initialize agents for different marketing platforms using model_name
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name="Twitter Agent",
        system_prompt="Create a tweet",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="Instagram Agent",
        system_prompt="Create an Instagram post",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="Facebook Agent",
        system_prompt="Create a Facebook post",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="LinkedIn Agent",
        system_prompt="Create a LinkedIn post",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1
    ),
    Agent(
        agent_name="Email Agent",
        system_prompt="Write a marketing email",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1
    ),
]

# Create the Spreadsheet Swarm
swarm = SpreadSheetSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    save_file_path="real_estate_marketing_spreadsheet.csv",
    run_all_agents=False,
    max_loops=2
)

# Run the swarm
swarm.run("Create posts to promote luxury properties in North Texas.")
```

---

These are the key swarm architectures available in the **Swarms Framework**. Each one is designed to solve different types of multi-agent orchestration problems, from sequential tasks to large-scale parallel processing.

# Swarms Framework Environment Configuration

This guide details the environment variables used in the Swarms framework for configuration and customization of your agent-based applications.

## Configuration Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory to configure the Swarms framework. This file will contain all necessary environment variables for customizing your agent's behavior, logging, and analytics.

## Environment Variables

### Core Variables

#### `WORKSPACE_DIR`
- **Purpose**: Defines the directory where all agent states and execution logs are stored
- **Type**: String (path)
- **Default**: `./workspace`
- **Example**: 
```bash
WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/your/workspace
```
- **Usage**:
  - Stores JSON files containing agent states
  - Maintains execution history
  - Keeps track of agent interactions
  - Preserves conversation logs

#### `SWARMS_AUTOUPDATE_ON`
- **Purpose**: Controls automatic updates of the Swarms framework
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `false`

```bash
SWARMS_AUTOUPDATE_ON=true
```
- **Features**:
  - Automatically updates to the latest stable version
  - Ensures you have the newest features
  - Maintains compatibility with the latest improvements
  - Handles dependency updates
- **Considerations**:
  - Set to `false` if you need version stability
  - Recommended `true` for development environments
  - Consider system requirements for auto-updates
  - May require restart after updates

### Telemetry Configuration

#### `USE_TELEMETRY`
- **Purpose**: Controls whether telemetry data is collected
- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `false`
- **Example**:
```bash
USE_TELEMETRY=true
```
- **Data Collected**:
  - Agent performance metrics
  - Execution time statistics
  - Memory usage

```

3. Obtain your API key:
   - Visit [swarms.ai](https://swarms.ai)
   - Create an account or log in
   - Navigate to the API section
   - Generate your unique API key

## Best Practices

1. **Security**:
   - Never commit your `.env` file to version control
   - Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
   - Keep your API keys secure and rotate them periodically

2. **Workspace Organization**:
   - Use descriptive workspace directory names
   - Implement regular cleanup of old logs
   - Monitor workspace size to prevent disk space issues

3. **Telemetry Management**:
   - Enable telemetry in development for debugging
   - Consider privacy implications in production
   - Review collected data periodically

4. **Auto-Update Management**:
   - Test updates in development before enabling in production
   - Keep backups before enabling auto-updates
   - Monitor system resources during updates
   - Schedule updates during low-traffic periods

## Examples

### Basic Development Setup
```bash
WORKSPACE_DIR=./dev_workspace
SWARMS_AUTOUPDATE_ON=true
USE_TELEMETRY=true
SWARMS_API_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

# Integrating the Agent Class with Memory Systems/RAG in the Swarms Memory Framework

In this guide, we will cover how to integrate various memory systems from the Swarms Memory framework into an agent class. The Swarms Memory framework allows for the integration of different database-backed memory systems, enabling agents to retain and query long-term knowledge effectively. We'll walk through examples of integrating with Pinecone, ChromaDB, and Faiss, showcasing how to configure custom functions and embed memory functionality into an agent class.

## Installation

First, you need to install the Swarms Memory package:

```bash
$ pip install swarms swarms-memory
```


### Integrating ChromaDB with the Agent Class

ChromaDB is a simple, high-performance vector store for use with embeddings. Here's how you can integrate ChromaDB:

```python
from swarms_memory import ChromaDB
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent

# Initialize ChromaDB memory
chromadb_memory = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    output_dir="finance_agent_rag",
)

# Initialize the Financial Analysis Agent with GPT-4o-mini model
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt="Agent system prompt here",
    agent_description="Agent performs financial analysis.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    long_term_memory=chromadb_memory,
)

# Run a query
response = agent.run(
    "What are the components of a startup's stock incentive equity plan?"
)
print(response)
```

### Integrating Faiss with the Agent Class

Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Here's how you can integrate Faiss:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from swarms_memory.faiss_wrapper import FAISSDB
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import Anthropic
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

## Mermaid Graphs for Visualizing Integration

To help visualize the integration process, here's a Mermaid graph illustrating how an agent interacts with the memory systems:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Agent] -->|Queries| B[Memory System]
    B --> C{Pinecone / ChromaDB / Faiss}
    C --> D[Embedding Function]
    D --> E[LLM Model]
    E --> F[Query Results]
    F -->|Returns| A
```

This graph shows the flow from the agent sending queries to the memory system, which processes them using the embedding function and LLM model, and finally returns the results back to the agent.

## Conclusion

Integrating various memory systems from the Swarms Memory framework into the agent class enables the creation of powerful, memory-augmented agents capable of retaining and recalling information over time. Whether you're using Pinecone, ChromaDB, or Faiss, the process involves initializing the memory system, embedding functions, and then passing this memory system to the agent class. The examples and visualizations provided should help you get started with building your own memory-augmented agents.

Happy coding!

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Using OpenAI's GPT-4
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Research-Agent",
    model_name="openai/gpt-4o",  # Note the provider/model_name format
    # ... other parameters
)

# Using Anthropic's Claude
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Analysis-Agent",
    model_name="anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229",  # Note the provider/model_name format
    # ... other parameters
)

```

## Model Configuration

When using different models, you can configure various parameters:

```python
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Custom-Agent",
    model_name="openai/gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7,  # Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
    max_tokens=2000,  # Maximum tokens in response
    top_p=0.9,       # Nucleus sampling parameter
    frequency_penalty=0.0,  # Reduces repetition
    presence_penalty=0.0,   # Encourages new topics
    # ... other parameters
)
```

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
!!! tip "Choosing the Right Model"
    - Choose models based on your specific use case
    - Consider cost, performance, and feature requirements
    - Test different models for your specific task

### Error Handling

# **Documentation for the `Anthropic` Class**

## **Overview and Introduction**

The `Anthropic` class provides an interface to interact with the Anthropic large language models. This class encapsulates the necessary functionality to request completions from the Anthropic API based on a provided prompt and other configurable parameters.

### **Key Concepts and Terminology**

- **Anthropic**: A large language model, akin to GPT-3 and its successors.
- **Prompt**: A piece of text that serves as the starting point for model completions.
- **Stop Sequences**: Specific tokens or sequences to indicate when the model should stop generating.
- **Tokens**: Discrete pieces of information in a text. For example, in English, a token can be as short as one character or as long as one word.
  
## **Class Definition**

### `Anthropic`
```python
class Anthropic:
    """Anthropic large language models."""
```

### Parameters:

- `model (str)`: The name of the model to use for completions. Default is "claude-2".
  
- `max_tokens_to_sample (int)`: Maximum number of tokens to generate in the output. Default is 256.
  
- `temperature (float, optional)`: Sampling temperature. A higher value will make the output more random, while a lower value will make it more deterministic.
  
- `top_k (int, optional)`: Sample from the top-k most probable next tokens. Setting this parameter can reduce randomness in the output.
  
- `top_p (float, optional)`: Sample from the smallest set of tokens such that their cumulative probability exceeds the specified value. Used in nucleus sampling to provide a balance between randomness and determinism.
  
- `streaming (bool)`: Whether to stream the output or not. Default is False.
  
- `default_request_timeout (int, optional)`: Default timeout in seconds for API requests. Default is 600.

### **Methods and their Functionality**

#### `_default_params(self) -> dict`

- Provides the default parameters for calling the Anthropic API.
  
- **Returns**: A dictionary containing the default parameters.

#### `generate(self, prompt: str, stop: list[str] = None) -> str`

- Calls out to Anthropic's completion endpoint to generate text based on the given prompt.
  
- **Parameters**:
    - `prompt (str)`: The input text to provide context for the generated text.
      
    - `stop (list[str], optional)`: Sequences to indicate when the model should stop generating.
      
- **Returns**: A string containing the model's generated completion based on the prompt.

#### `__call__(self, prompt: str, stop: list[str] = None) -> str`

- An alternative to the `generate` method that allows calling the class instance directly.
  
- **Parameters**:
    - `prompt (str)`: The input text to provide context for the generated text.
      
    - `stop (list[str], optional)`: Sequences to indicate when the model should stop generating.
      
- **Returns**: A string containing the model's generated completion based on the prompt.

## **Usage Examples**

```python
# Import necessary modules and classes
from swarm_models import Anthropic

# Initialize an instance of the Anthropic class
model = Anthropic(anthropic_api_key="")

# Using the run method
completion_1 = model.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(completion_1)

# Using the __call__ method
completion_2 = model("How far is the moon from the earth?", stop=["miles", "km"])
print(completion_2)
```

## **Mathematical Formula**

The underlying operations of the `Anthropic` class involve probabilistic sampling based on token logits from the Anthropic model. Mathematically, the process of generating a token \( t \) from the given logits \( l \) can be described by the softmax function:

\[ P(t) = \frac{e^{l_t}}{\sum_{i} e^{l_i}} \]

Where:
- \( P(t) \) is the probability of token \( t \).
- \( l_t \) is the logit corresponding to token \( t \).
- The summation runs over all possible tokens.

The temperature, top-k, and top-p parameters are further used to modulate the probabilities.

## **Additional Information and Tips**

- Ensure you have a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set as an environment variable or passed during class instantiation.
  
- Always handle exceptions that may arise from API timeouts or invalid prompts.

## 3. Implementation <a name="implementation"></a>

The `BaseLLM` class serves as the base for implementing specific language models. Subclasses of `BaseLLM` should implement the `run` method to define how text is generated for a given task. This design allows flexibility in integrating different language models while maintaining a common interface.

## 4. Usage Examples <a name="usage-examples"></a>

To demonstrate how to use the `BaseLLM` interface, let's create an example using a hypothetical language model. We'll initialize an instance of the model and generate text for a simple task.

```python
# Import the BaseLLM class
from swarm_models import BaseLLM

# Create an instance of the language model
language_model = BaseLLM(
    model_name="my_language_model",
    max_tokens=50,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=50,

responses = model.run_batch_async(tasks_images)
for response in responses:
    print(response)
```

### Example 4: Inheriting `BaseMultiModalModel` for it's prebuilt classes
```python
from swarm_models import BaseMultiModalModel


class CustomMultiModalModel(BaseMultiModalModel):
    def __init__(self, model_name, custom_parameter, *args, **kwargs):
        # Call the parent class constructor
        super().__init__(model_name=model_name, *args, **kwargs)
        # Initialize custom parameters specific to your model
        self.custom_parameter = custom_parameter

    def __call__(self, text, img):
        # Implement the multimodal model logic here
        # You can use self.custom_parameter and other inherited attributes
        pass

    def generate_summary(self, text):
        # Implement the summary generation logic using your model
        # You can use self.custom_parameter and other inherited attributes
        pass


# Create an instance of your custom multimodal model
custom_model = CustomMultiModalModel(
    model_name="your_custom_model_name",
    custom_parameter="your_custom_value",
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=500,
    device="cuda",
)

# Run your custom model
response = custom_model.run(
    "Generate a summary of this text", "https://www.example.com/image.jpg"
)
print(response)

# Generate a summary using your custom model
summary = custom_model.generate_summary("This is a sample text to summarize.")
print(summary)
```

In the code above:

1. We define a `CustomMultiModalModel` class that inherits from `BaseMultiModalModel`.

2. In the constructor of our custom class, we call the parent class constructor using `super()` and initialize any custom parameters specific to our model. In this example, we introduced a `custom_parameter`.

3. We override the `__call__` method, which is responsible for running the multimodal model logic. Here, you can implement the specific behavior of your model, considering both text and image inputs.

4. We override the `generate_summary` method, which is used to generate a summary of text input. You can implement your custom summarization logic here.

5. We create an instance of our custom model, passing the required parameters, including the custom parameter.

6. We demonstrate how to run the custom model and generate a summary using it.

By inheriting from `BaseMultiModalModel`, you can leverage the prebuilt features and methods provided by the library while customizing the behavior of your multimodal model. This allows you to create powerful and specialized models for various multimodal tasks.

These examples demonstrate how to use MultiModalAI to run multimodal models with text and image inputs. You can adjust the parameters and methods to suit your specific use cases.

## 6. Additional Tips <a name="additional-tips"></a>

Here are some additional tips and considerations for using MultiModalAI effectively:

- **Custom Models**: You can create your own multimodal models and inherit from the `BaseMultiModalModel` class to integrate them with this library.

- **Retries**: In cases where text generation might fail due to various reasons (e.g., server issues), using methods with retries can be helpful.

- **Monitoring**: You can monitor the performance of your model using methods like `_tokens_per_second()` and `_time_for_generation()`.

- **Chat History**: The library maintains a chat history, allowing you to keep track of interactions.

- **Streaming**: The `stream()` method can be useful for displaying output character by character, which can be helpful for certain applications.

# How to Create A Custom Language Model

When working with advanced language models, there might come a time when you need a custom solution tailored to your specific needs. Inheriting from an `BaseLLM` in a Python framework allows developers to create custom language model classes with ease. This developer guide will take you through the process step by step.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

- A working knowledge of Python programming.
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.
- Familiarity with language models and natural language processing (NLP).
- The appropriate Python framework installed, with access to `BaseLLM`.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Understand `BaseLLM`

The `BaseLLM` is an abstract base class that defines a set of methods and properties which your custom language model (LLM) should implement. Abstract classes in Python are not designed to be instantiated directly but are meant to be subclasses.

#### Step 2: Create a New Class

Start by defining a new class that inherits from `BaseLLM`. This class will implement the required methods defined in the abstract base class.

```python
from swarms import BaseLLM

class vLLMLM(BaseLLM):
    pass
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Your Class

Implement the `__init__` method to initialize your custom LLM. You'll want to initialize the base class as well and define any additional parameters for your model.

```python
class vLLMLM(BaseLLM):
    def __init__(self, model_name='default_model', tensor_parallel_size=1, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.tensor_parallel_size = tensor_parallel_size
        # Add any additional initialization here
```

#### Step 4: Implement Required Methods

Implement the `run` method or any other abstract methods required by `BaseLLM`. This is where you define how your model processes input and returns output.

```python
class vLLMLM(BaseLLM):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):
        # Logic for running your model goes here
        return "Processed output"
```

#### Step 5: Test Your Model

Instantiate your custom LLM and test it to ensure that it works as expected.

```python
model = vLLMLM(model_name='my_custom_model', tensor_parallel_size=2)
output = model.run("What are the symptoms of COVID-19?")
print(output)  # Outputs: "Processed output"
```

#### Step 6: Integrate Additional Components

Depending on the requirements, you might need to integrate additional components such as database connections, parallel computing resources, or custom processing pipelines.

#### Step 7: Documentation

Write comprehensive docstrings for your class and its methods. Good documentation is crucial for maintaining the code and for other developers who might use your model.

```python
class vLLMLM(BaseLLM):
    """
    A custom language model class that extends BaseLLM.
    
    ... more detailed docstring ...
    """
    # ... existing code ...
```

#### Step 8: Best Practices

Follow best practices such as error handling, input validation, and resource management to ensure your model is robust and reliable.

#### Step 9: Packaging Your Model

Package your custom LLM class into a module or package that can be easily distributed and imported into other projects.

#### Step 10: Version Control and Collaboration

Use a version control system like Git to track changes to your model. This makes collaboration easier and helps you keep a history of your work.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you should now have a custom model that extends the `BaseLLM`. Remember that the key to a successful custom LLM is understanding the base functionalities, implementing necessary changes, and testing thoroughly. Keep iterating and improving based on feedback and performance metrics.

### Further Reading

- Official Python documentation on abstract base classes.
- In-depth tutorials on object-oriented programming in Python.
- Advanced NLP techniques and optimization strategies for language models.

This guide provides the fundamental steps to create custom models using `BaseLLM`. For detailed implementation and advanced customization, it's essential to dive deeper into the specific functionalities and capabilities of the language model framework you are using.

task = "A small painting of a cat"

# Generate a smaller image from the text prompt
image_url = dalle3(task)

# Print the generated image URL
print(image_url)
```

### Example 4: Adjusting Retry Limit

You can adjust the maximum number of API request retries using the `max_retries` parameter. Here's how to increase the retry limit:

```python
from swarm_models.dalle3 import Dalle3

# Create an instance of the Dalle3 class with a higher retry limit
dalle3 = Dalle3(max_retries=5)

# Define a text prompt
task = "An image of a landscape"

# Generate an image with a higher retry limit
image_url = dalle3(task)

# Print the generated image URL
print(image_url)
```

### Example 5: Generating Image Variations

To create variations of an existing image, you can use the `create_variations` method. Here's an example:

```python
from swarm_models.dalle3 import Dalle3

# Create an instance of the Dalle3 class
dalle3 = Dalle3()

# Define the URL of an existing image
img_url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1677290043066-12eccd944004?q=80&w=1287&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"

# Create variations of the image
variations_url = dalle3.create_variations(img_url)

# Print the URLs of the generated variations
print(variations_url)
```

### Example 6: Handling API Errors

The Dalle3 library provides error handling for API-related issues. Here's how to handle and display API errors:

```python
from swarm_models.dalle3 import Dalle3

# Create an instance of the Dalle3 class
dalle3 = Dalle3()

# Define a text prompt
task = "Invalid prompt that may cause an API error"

try:
    # Attempt to generate an image with an invalid prompt
    image_url = dalle3(task)
    print(image_url)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

### Example 7: Customizing Image Quality

You can customize the quality of the generated image by specifying the `quality` parameter. Here's how to generate a high-quality image:

```python
from swarm_models.dalle3 import Dalle3

# Create an instance of the Dalle3 class with high quality
dalle3 = Dalle3(quality="high")

# Define a text prompt
task = "A high-quality image of a sunset"

# Generate a high-quality image from the text prompt
image_url = dalle3(task)

# Print the generated image URL
print(image_url)
```

| `model_name`        | str     | The name of the Gemini model.                                    | "gemini-pro"       |
| `gemini_api_key`    | str     | The Gemini API key. If not provided, it is fetched from the environment. | (None)             |

- `model_name`: Specifies the name of the Gemini model to use. By default, it is set to "gemini-pro," but you can specify a different model if needed.

- `gemini_api_key`: This parameter allows you to provide your Gemini API key directly. If not provided, the constructor attempts to fetch it from the environment using the `get_gemini_api_key_env` helper function.

##### Methods

1. **run()**

   ```python
   def run(
       self,
       task: str = None,
       img: str = None,
       *args,
       **kwargs,
   ) -> str:
   ```

   | Parameter     | Type     | Description                                |
   |---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
   | `task`        | str      | The textual task for content generation.  |
   | `img`         | str      | The path to the image to be processed.    |
   | `*args`       | Variable | Additional positional arguments.           |
   | `**kwargs`    | Variable | Additional keyword arguments.              |

   - `task`: Specifies the textual task for content generation. It can be a sentence or a phrase that describes the desired content.

   - `img`: Provides the path to the image that will be processed along with the textual task. Gemini combines the visual information from the image with the textual task to generate content.

   - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Allow for additional, flexible arguments that can be passed to the underlying Gemini model. These arguments can vary based on the specific Gemini model being used.

   **Returns**: A string containing the generated content.

   **Examples**:

   ```python
   from swarm_models import Gemini

   # Initialize the Gemini model
   gemini = Gemini()

   # Generate content for a textual task with an image
   generated_content = gemini.run(
       task="Describe this image",
       img="image.jpg",
   )

   # Print the generated content
   print(generated_content)
   ```

   In this example, we initialize the Gemini model, provide a textual task, and specify an image for processing. The `run()` method generates content based on the input and returns the result.

2. **process_img()**

   ```python
   def process_img(
       self,
       img: str = None,
       type: str = "image/png",
       *args,
       **kwargs,
   ):
   ```

   | Parameter     | Type     | Description                                          | Default Value |
   |---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
   | `img`         | str      | The path to the image to be processed.              | (None)         |
   | `type`        | str      | The MIME type of the image (e.g., "image/png").    | "image/png"    |
   | `*args`       | Variable | Additional positional arguments.                     |
   | `**kwargs`    | Variable | Additional keyword arguments.                        |

   - `img`: Specifies the path to the image that will be processed. It's essential to provide a valid image path for image-based content generation.

   - `type`: Indicates the MIME type of the image. By default, it is set to "image/png," but you can change it based on the image format you're using.

   - `*args` and `**kwargs`: Allow for additional, flexible arguments that can be passed to the underlying Gemini model. These arguments can vary based on the specific Gemini model being used.

   **Raises**: ValueError if any of the following conditions are met:
   - No image is provided.
   - The image type is not specified.
   - The Gemini API key is missing.

   **Examples**:

   ```python
   from swarm_models.gemini import Gemini

   # Initialize the Gemini model
   gemini = Gemini()

   # Process an image
   processed_image = gemini.process_img(
       img="image.jpg",
       type="image/jpeg",
   )

   # Further use the processed image in content generation
   generated_content = gemini.run(
       task="Describe this image",
       img=processed_image,
   )

   # Print the generated content
   print(generated_content)
   ```

   In this example, we demonstrate how to process an image using the `process_img()` method and then use the processed image in content generation.

   - If you do not have an API key, look for an option to generate a new key. Follow the prompts to create your API key. Make sure to copy it to your clipboard.

## Step 2: Create a `.env` File

1. **Create the File**:
   - In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env`.

2. **Add Your API Key**:
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing `your_groq_api_key_here` with the API key you copied earlier:

   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Save the File**:
   - Save the changes to the `.env` file.



## Full Example
```python
import os
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Get the OpenAI API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")

# Model
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_base="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    model_name="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    temperature=0.1,
)

model.run("What are the best metrics to track and understand risk in private equity")
```

## Important Notes

- **Keep Your API Key Secure**: Do not share your API key publicly or commit it to version control systems like Git. Use the `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.env` file from being tracked.
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure to install any necessary libraries (like `python-dotenv`) to load environment variables from the `.env` file if your project requires it.


## Conclusion

You are now ready to use the Groq API in your project! If you encounter any issues, refer to the Groq documentation or support for further assistance.

# HuggingFaceLLM 

## Overview & Introduction

The `HuggingFaceLLM` class in the Zeta library provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to harness the power of Hugging Face's transformer-based language models, specifically for causal language modeling. This enables developers to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences or paragraphs given a prompt, without delving deep into the intricate details of the underlying model or the tokenization process.

Causal Language Modeling (CLM) is a task where given a series of tokens (or words), the model predicts the next token in the sequence. This functionality is central to many natural language processing tasks, including chatbots, story generation, and code autocompletion.

---

## Class Definition

```python
class HuggingFaceLLM:
```

### Parameters:

- `model_id (str)`: Identifier for the pre-trained model on the Hugging Face model hub. Examples include "gpt2-medium", "openai-gpt", etc.
  
- `device (str, optional)`: The device on which to load and run the model. Defaults to 'cuda' if GPU is available, else 'cpu'.
  
- `max_length (int, optional)`: Maximum length of the generated sequence. Defaults to 20.
  
- `quantization_config (dict, optional)`: Configuration dictionary for model quantization (if applicable). Default is `None`.

---

## Functionality & Usage

### Initialization:

```python
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(model_id="gpt2-medium")
```

Upon initialization, the specified pre-trained model and tokenizer are loaded from Hugging Face's model hub. The model is then moved to the designated device. If there's an issue loading either the model or the tokenizer, an error will be logged.

### Generation:

The main functionality of this class is text generation. The class provides two methods for this: `__call__` and `generate`. Both methods take in a prompt text and an optional `max_length` parameter and return the generated text.

Usage:
```python
from swarms import HuggingFaceLLM

# Initialize
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(model_id="gpt2-medium")

# Generate text using __call__ method
result = llm("Once upon a time,")
print(result)

# Alternatively, using the generate method
result = llm.generate("The future of AI is")
print(result)
```

---

## Mathematical Explanation:

Given a sequence of tokens \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \), a causal language model aims to maximize the likelihood of the next token \( x_{n+1} \) in the sequence. Formally, it tries to optimize:

\[ P(x_{n+1} | x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \]

Where \( P \) is the probability distribution over all possible tokens in the vocabulary.

The model takes the tokenized input sequence, feeds it through several transformer blocks, and finally through a linear layer to produce logits for each token in the vocabulary. The token with the highest logit value is typically chosen as the next token in the sequence.

---

## Additional Information & Tips:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection when initializing the class for the first time, as the models and tokenizers are fetched from Hugging Face's servers.

- Although the default `max_length` is set to 20, it's advisable to adjust this parameter based on the context of the problem.

- Keep an eye on GPU memory when using large models or generating long sequences.

2. **Prompt-Based Inference**: You can use the `infer` method to generate text based on prompts. It processes prompts in batched or non-batched mode, depending on your preference. It uses a pre-trained processor to handle text and images.

3. **Bidirectional Conversation**: The `chat` method enables bidirectional conversations. You provide user input, and the model responds accordingly. The chat history is maintained for context.

4. **Configuration Changes**: You can change the model checkpoint, device, maximum text length, or clear the chat history as needed during runtime.

## Parameters

- `checkpoint`: The name of the pre-trained model checkpoint (default is "HuggingFaceM4/idefics-9b-instruct").
- `device`: The device to use for inference. By default, it uses CUDA if available; otherwise, it uses CPU.
- `torch_dtype`: The data type to use for inference. By default, it uses torch.bfloat16.
- `max_length`: The maximum length of the generated text (default is 100).

## Additional Information

- Idefics provides a convenient way to engage in bidirectional conversations with pre-trained models.
- You can easily change the model checkpoint, device, and other settings to adapt to your specific use case.

That concludes the documentation for Idefics. We hope you find this tool valuable for your multimodal text generation tasks. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please refer to the Hugging Face Transformers documentation for further assistance. Enjoy working with Idefics!

load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from the environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the GPT4VisionAPI class
gpt4vision = GPT4VisionAPI(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_tokens=1000,
    openai_proxy="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
)

# Define the URL of the image to analyze
img = "ear.png"

# Define the task to perform on the image
task = "What is this image"

# Run the GPT4VisionAPI on the image with the specified task
answer = gpt4vision.run(task, img, return_json=True)

# Print the answer
print(answer)
```

#### Using the QwenVLMultiModal Model

The QwenVLMultiModal model is designed for multi-modal tasks, such as processing both text and images. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from swarms import QwenVLMultiModal

# Instantiate the QwenVLMultiModal model
model = QwenVLMultiModal(
    model_name="Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat",
    device="cuda",
    quantize=True,
)

# Run the model
response = model("Hello, how are you?", "https://example.com/image.jpg")

# Print the response
print(response)
```


### Common Methods in Swarms

Swarms provides several common methods that are useful across different models. One of the most frequently used methods is `__call__`.

#### The `__call__` Method

The `__call__` method is used to run the model on a given task. Here is a generic example:

```python
# Assuming `model` is an instance of any supported model
task = "Explain the theory of relativity."
response = model(task)
print(response)
```

This method abstracts the complexity of interacting with different model APIs, providing a consistent interface for executing tasks.

### Common Settings in Swarms

Swarms allows you to configure various settings to customize the behavior of the models. Here are some common settings:

#### API Keys

API keys are essential for authenticating and accessing the models. These keys are typically set through environment variables:

```python
import os

# Set API keys as environment variables
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your_openai_api_key'
os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] = 'your_anthropic_api_key'
```

#### Model-Specific Settings

Different models may have specific settings that need to be configured. For example, the `AzureOpenAI` model requires several settings related to the Azure environment:

```python
model = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT"),
    openai_api_version=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_ad_token=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN"),
)
```

### Advanced Usage and Best Practices

To make the most out of the Swarms framework, consider the following best practices:

#### Extensive Logging

Use logging to monitor the behavior and performance of your models. The `loguru` library is recommended for its simplicity and flexibility:

```python
from loguru import logger

# Log model interactions
logger.info("Running task on Anthropic model")
response = model(task)
logger.info(f"Response: {response}")
```

#### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to manage API failures and other issues gracefully:

```python
try:
    response = model(task)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error running task: {e}")
    response = "An error occurred while processing your request."
print(response)
```

### Conclusion

The Swarms framework provides a powerful and flexible way to integrate and manage multiple AI models within a single application. By following the guidelines and examples provided in this blog, you can leverage Swarms to build sophisticated, multi-agent systems with ease. Whether you're using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, or Hugging Face,

out = model.run("The hotel was average, but the food was excellent.")
print(out)

```

## Additional Information and Tips

- Ensure that your OpenAI API key is securely stored and not hard-coded into your source code. Use environment variables to manage sensitive information.
- Adjust the `temperature` and `top_p` parameters to control the randomness and diversity of the generated responses. Lower values for `temperature` will result in more deterministic outputs, while higher values will introduce more variability.
- When using `parallel_tool_calls`, ensure that the tools you are calling in parallel are thread-safe and can handle concurrent execution.

# **The Essence of Enterprise-Grade Prompting**

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized the landscape of AI-driven automation, customer support, marketing, and more. However, extracting the highest quality output from these models requires a thoughtful approach to crafting prompts—an endeavor that goes beyond mere trial and error. In enterprise settings, where consistency, quality, and performance are paramount, enterprise-grade prompting has emerged as a structured discipline, combining art with the science of human-machine communication.

Enterprise-grade prompting involves understanding the intricate dynamics between language models, context, and the task at hand. It requires knowledge of not only the technical capabilities of LLMs but also the intricacies of how they interpret human language. Effective prompting becomes the linchpin for ensuring that AI-driven outputs are accurate, reliable, and aligned with business needs. It is this discipline that turns raw AI capabilities into tangible enterprise value.

In this essay, we will dissect the essence of enterprise-grade prompting, explore the most effective prompting strategies, explain what works and what doesn't, and conclude with the current holy grail of automated prompt engineering. We will also share concrete examples and illustrations of each technique, with a particular focus on their application in an enterprise setting.

## **1. Foundational Principles of Prompting**

The effectiveness of prompting lies in understanding both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs. A well-structured prompt helps LLMs focus on the most relevant information while avoiding ambiguities that can lead to unreliable results. In enterprise-grade contexts, prompts must be designed with the end-user's expectations in mind, ensuring quality, safety, scalability, and traceability.

- **Clarity**: Prompts should be clear and devoid of unnecessary jargon. Ambiguity can misguide the model, leading to poor-quality output. For enterprise use, clarity means avoiding misunderstandings that could affect customer relationships or lead to non-compliance with regulations.
- **Context**: Providing sufficient context ensures the model understands the nuances of the prompt. For example, specifying whether a response is aimed at a technical audience versus a general audience can lead to more accurate outputs. Context is essential in creating responses that are not only accurate but also relevant to the target audience.
- **Instruction Granularity**: The level of detail in the instruction significantly impacts the quality of the output. Broad instructions might lead to vagueness, whereas overly detailed instructions could overwhelm the model. Finding the right balance is key to generating useful responses.

Example: Instead of prompting "Explain what a blockchain is," an enterprise-grade prompt might be "Explain the concept of blockchain, focusing on how distributed ledgers help increase transparency in supply chain management. Keep the explanation under 200 words for a general audience." This prompt provides clear, relevant, and concise instructions tailored to specific needs.

## **2. Best Prompting Strategies**

The field of enterprise-grade prompting employs numerous strategies to maximize the quality of LLM output. Here are some of the most effective ones:

### **2.1. Instruction-Based Prompting**

Instruction-based prompting provides explicit instructions for the LLM to follow. This approach is valuable in enterprise applications where responses must adhere to a specific tone, structure, or depth of analysis.

**Example**:

- "Summarize the following press release in 3 bullet points suitable for a marketing team meeting."

This prompt is highly effective because it instructs the model on what format (bullet points), audience (marketing team), and depth (summary) to produce, minimizing the risk of irrelevant details.

**Why It Works**: LLMs excel when they have a clear set of rules to follow. Enterprises benefit from this structured approach, as it ensures consistency across multiple use cases, be it marketing, HR, or customer service. Clear instructions also make it easier to validate outputs against defined expectations, which is crucial for maintaining quality.

### **2.2. Multi-Shot Prompting**

Multi-shot prompting provides several examples before asking the model to complete a task. This helps set expectations by showing the model the desired style and type of output.

**Example**:

- "Here are some example customer support responses:
  1. Customer: 'I can't access my account.'
     Response: 'We're sorry you're having trouble accessing your account. Please try resetting your password using the link provided.'
  2. Customer: 'I received a damaged item.'
     Response: 'We apologize for the damaged item. Please provide us with your order number so we can send a replacement.'

- Customer: 'The app keeps crashing on my phone.'
  Response:"

**Why It Works**: Multi-shot prompting is highly effective in enterprise-grade applications where consistency is critical. Showing multiple examples helps the model learn patterns without needing extensive fine-tuning, saving both time and cost. Enterprises can leverage this technique to ensure that responses remain aligned with brand standards and customer expectations across different departments.

### **2.3. Chain of Thought Prompting**

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting helps LLMs generate reasoning steps explicitly before arriving at an answer. This method is useful for complex problem-solving tasks or when transparency in decision-making is important.

**Example**:

- "A logistics company wants to minimize fuel costs across multiple delivery routes. Here are the conditions: Each truck has a fuel capacity of 100 gallons, and the price of fuel fluctuates per state. Think through the most cost-effective approach for planning delivery, step by step."

**Why It Works**: CoT prompting allows the model to work through the process iteratively, providing more explainable results. In enterprise applications where complex decision-making is involved, this strategy ensures stakeholders understand why a particular output was generated. This transparency is crucial in high-stakes areas like finance, healthcare, and logistics, where understanding the reasoning behind an output is as important as the output itself.

### **2.4. Iterative Feedback and Adaptive Prompting**

Iterative prompting involves providing multiple prompts or rounds of feedback to refine the output. Adaptive prompts take prior responses and adjust based on context, ensuring the final output meets the required standard.

**Example**:

- First Prompt: "Generate a mission statement for our AI-driven logistics company."
  - Model Response: "We use artificial intelligence to enhance logistics."
  - Follow-up Prompt: "Can you make the statement more specific by mentioning how AI improves efficiency and sustainability?"

**Why It Works**: Enterprises require output that is precise and tailored to brand identity. Iterative feedback provides an effective means to adjust and refine outputs until the desired quality is achieved. By breaking down the task into multiple feedback loops, enterprises can ensure the final output is aligned with their core values and objectives.

### **2.5. Contextual Expansion for Enhanced Relevance**

A lesser-known but powerful strategy is contextual expansion. This involves expanding the prompt to include broader information about the context, thereby allowing the model to generate richer, more relevant responses.

**Example**:

- Original Prompt: "Write a response to a customer asking for a refund."
  - Contextually Expanded Prompt: "Write a response to a customer asking for a refund on a recently purchased product. The customer expressed dissatisfaction with the quality and mentioned they want the process to be quick. Ensure the response is empathetic and explains the refund process clearly, while also offering alternative solutions like an exchange if possible."

**Why It Works**: By including more context, the prompt allows the model to generate a response that feels more tailored to the customer's situation, enhancing both satisfaction and trust. Enterprises benefit from this approach by increasing the quality of customer service interactions.

## **3. What Doesn't Work in Prompting**

While the above methods are effective, prompting can often fall short in certain scenarios:

### **3.1. Overly Vague Prompts**

An insufficiently detailed prompt results in vague outputs. For example, simply asking "What are some strategies to grow a business?" can lead to generic responses that lack actionable insight. Vague prompts are particularly problematic in enterprise settings where specificity is crucial to drive action.

### **3.2. Excessive Length**

Overloading a prompt with details often causes the LLM to become confused, producing incomplete or inaccurate responses. For example, "Explain blockchain, focusing on cryptographic methods, network nodes, ledger distribution, proof of work, mining processes, hash functions, transaction validation, etc." attempts to include too many subjects for a concise response. Enterprise-grade prompts should focus on a specific area to avoid overwhelming the model and degrading the output quality.

### **3.3. Ambiguity in Expected Output**

Ambiguity arises when prompts don't clearly specify the desired output format, tone, or length. For example, asking "Describe our new product" without specifying whether it should be a single-line summary, a paragraph, or a technical overview can lead to an unpredictable response. Enterprises must clearly define expectations to ensure consistent and high-quality outputs.

## **4. The Holy Grail: Automated Prompt Engineering**

In an enterprise setting, scaling prompt engineering for consistency and high performance remains a key challenge. Automated Prompt Engineering (APE) offers a potential solution for bridging the gap between individual craftsmanship and enterprise-wide implementation.

**4.1. AI-Augmented Prompt Design**

Automated Prompt Engineering tools can evaluate the outputs generated by various prompts, selecting the one with the highest quality metrics. These tools can be trained to understand what constitutes an ideal response for specific enterprise contexts.

**Example**:

- An APE system takes multiple variations of a prompt for generating email responses to customer complaints. After evaluating the sentiment, tone, and accuracy of each response, it selects the prompt that yields the most favorable output for business goals.

**Why It Works**: AI-Augmented Prompt Design reduces the need for manual intervention and standardizes the quality of responses across the organization. This approach helps enterprises maintain consistency while saving valuable time that would otherwise be spent on trial-and-error prompting.

**4.2. Reinforcement Learning for Prompts (RLP)**

Using Reinforcement Learning for Prompts involves training models to automatically iterate on prompts to improve the quality of the final output. The model is rewarded for generating responses that align with predefined criteria, such as clarity, completeness, or relevance.

**Example**:

- An enterprise uses RLP to refine prompts used in internal compliance checks. The model iteratively generates summaries of compliance reports, refining the prompt until it consistently generates clear, concise, and accurate summaries aligned with internal guidelines.

**Why It Works**: RLP can significantly improve the quality of complex outputs over time. Enterprises that require a high level of precision, such as in legal or compliance-related applications, benefit from RLP by ensuring outputs meet stringent standards.

**4.3. Dynamic Contextual Adaptation**

Another aspect of automated prompt engineering involves adapting prompts in real time based on user context. For example, if a user interacting with a customer support bot seems frustrated (as detected by sentiment analysis), an adaptive prompt may be used to generate a more empathetic response.

**Example**:

- User: "I'm really annoyed that my order hasn't arrived yet."
  - Prompt (adapted): "I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience you're experiencing. Please let me help you resolve this as quickly as possible. Could you provide your order number so I can check its status right away?"

**Why It Works**: In dynamic enterprise environments, where every user experience matters, adapting prompts to the immediate context can significantly improve customer satisfaction. Real-time adaptation allows the model to be more responsive and attuned to customer needs, thereby fostering loyalty and trust.

**4.4. Collaborative Prompt Refinement**

Automated prompt engineering can also involve collaboration between AI models and human experts. Collaborative Prompt Refinement (CPR) allows human operators to provide iterative guidance, which the model then uses to enhance its understanding and improve future outputs.

**Example**:

- A financial analyst uses a prompt to generate an investment report. The model provides an initial draft, and the analyst refines it with comments. The model learns from these comments and applies similar refinements to future reports, reducing the analyst’s workload over time.

**Why It Works**: CPR bridges the gap between human expertise and machine efficiency, ensuring that outputs are not only technically accurate but also aligned with expert expectations. This iterative learning loop enhances the model’s ability to autonomously generate high-quality content.

## **5. The Future of Enterprise-Grade Prompting**

The future of enterprise-grade prompting is in leveraging automation, context-awareness, and reinforcement learning. By moving from static prompts to dynamic, learning-enabled systems, enterprises can ensure consistent and optimized communication across their AI systems.

Automated systems such as APE and RLP are in their early stages, but they represent the potential to deliver highly scalable prompting solutions that automatically evolve based on user feedback and performance metrics. As more sophisticated models and methods become available, enterprise-grade prompting will likely involve:

- **Fully Adaptive Models**: Models that can detect and adjust to the tone, intent, and needs of users in real time. This means less manual intervention and greater responsiveness to user context.
- **Cross-Domain Learning**: Prompting systems that leverage insights across multiple domains to improve response quality. For example, lessons learned from customer service prompts could be applied to internal HR prompts to enhance employee communications.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Combining automated prompt generation with human validation to ensure compliance, accuracy, and brand consistency. Human-in-the-loop systems allow enterprises to leverage the efficiency of automation while maintaining a high level of quality control.

The rise of self-improving prompting systems marks a significant shift in how enterprises leverage AI for communication and decision-making. As more sophisticated models emerge, we anticipate a greater emphasis on adaptability, real-time learning, and seamless integration with existing business processes.

**Conclusion**

Enterprise-grade prompting transcends the art of crafting effective prompts into a well-defined process, merging structure with creativity and guided refinement. By understanding the foundational principles, leveraging strategies like instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting, and adopting automation, enterprises can consistently extract high-quality results from LLMs.

The evolution towards automated prompt engineering is transforming enterprise AI use from reactive problem-solving to proactive, intelligent decision-making. As the enterprise AI ecosystem matures, prompting will continue to be the linchpin that aligns the capabilities of LLMs with real-world business needs, ensuring optimal outcomes at scale.

Whether it's customer support, compliance, marketing, or operational analytics, the strategies outlined in this essay—paired with advancements in automated prompt engineering—hold the key to effective, scalable, and enterprise-grade utilization of AI models. Enterprises that invest in these methodologies today are likely to maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly automated business landscape.

## 1. Getting Started

### Installation and Setup

Before diving into how to use the `Prompt` class, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```


### Creating a New Prompt

To create a new instance of a `Prompt`, simply initialize it with the required attributes such as `content`:

```python
from swarms import Prompt

prompt = Prompt(
    content="This is my first prompt!",
    name="My First Prompt",
    description="A simple example prompt."
)

print(prompt)
```

This creates a new prompt with the current timestamp and a unique identifier.

---

## 2. Managing Prompt Content

### Editing Prompts

Once you have initialized a prompt, you can edit its content using the `edit_prompt` method. Each time the content is edited, a new version is stored in the `edit_history`, and the `last_modified_at` timestamp is updated.

```python
new_content = "This is an updated version of my prompt."
prompt.edit_prompt(new_content)
```

**Note**: If the new content is identical to the current content, an error will be raised to prevent unnecessary edits:

```python
try:
    prompt.edit_prompt("This is my first prompt!")  # Same as initial content
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: New content must be different from the current content.
```

### Retrieving Prompt Content

You can retrieve the current prompt content using the `get_prompt` method:

```python
current_content = prompt.get_prompt()
print(current_content)  # Output: This is an updated version of my prompt.
```

This method also logs telemetry data, which includes both system information and prompt metadata.

---

## 3. Version Control

### Tracking Edits and History

The `Prompt` class automatically tracks every change made to the prompt. This is stored in the `edit_history` attribute as a list of previous versions.

```python
print(prompt.edit_history)  # Output: ['This is my first prompt!', 'This is an updated version of my prompt.']
```

The number of edits is also tracked using the `edit_count` attribute:

```python
print(prompt.edit_count)  # Output: 2
```

### Rolling Back to Previous Versions

If you want to revert a prompt to a previous version, you can use the `rollback` method, passing the version index you want to revert to:

```python
prompt.rollback(0)
print(prompt.get_prompt())  # Output: This is my first prompt!
```

The rollback operation is thread-safe, and any rollback also triggers a telemetry log.

---

## 4. Autosaving Prompts

### Enabling and Configuring Autosave

To automatically save prompts to storage after every change, you can enable the `autosave` feature when initializing the prompt:

```python
prompt = Prompt(
    content="This is my first prompt!",
    autosave=True,
    autosave_folder="my_prompts"  # Specify the folder within WORKSPACE_DIR
)
```

This will ensure that every edit or rollback action triggers an autosave to the specified folder.

### Manually Triggering Autosave

You can also manually trigger an autosave by calling the `_autosave` method (which is a private method typically used internally):

```python
prompt._autosave()  # Manually triggers autosaving
```

Autosaves are stored as JSON files in the folder specified by `autosave_folder` under the workspace directory (`WORKSPACE_DIR` environment variable).

---

## 5. Logging and Telemetry

The `Prompt` class integrates with the `loguru` logging library to provide detailed logs for every major action, such as editing, rolling back, and saving. The `log_telemetry` method captures and logs system data, including prompt metadata, for each operation.

Here's an example of a log when editing a prompt:

```bash
2024-10-10 10:12:34.567 | INFO  | Editing prompt a7b8f9. Current content: 'This is my first prompt!'
2024-10-10 10:12:34.789 | DEBUG | Prompt a7b8f9 updated. Edit count: 1. New content: 'This is an updated version of my prompt.'
```

You can extend logging by integrating the `log_telemetry` method with your own telemetry systems or databases:

```python
prompt.log_telemetry()
```

---

## 6. Handling Errors

Error handling in the `Prompt` class is robust and prevents common mistakes, such as editing with identical content or rolling back to an invalid version. Here's a common scenario:

### Editing with Identical Content

```python
try:
    prompt.edit_prompt("This is an updated version of my prompt.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: New content must be different from the current content.
```

### Invalid Rollback Version

```python
try:
    prompt.rollback(10)  # Invalid version index
except IndexError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Invalid version number for rollback.
```

Always ensure that version numbers passed to `rollback` are within the valid range of existing versions.

---

## 7. Extending the Prompt Class

### Customizing the Save Mechanism

The `Prompt` class currently includes a placeholder for saving and loading prompts from persistent storage. You can override the `save_to_storage` and `load_from_storage` methods to integrate with databases, cloud storage, or other persistent layers.

Here's how you can implement the save functionality:

```python
def save_to_storage(self):
    # Example of saving to a database or cloud storage
    data = self.model_dump()
    save_to_database(data)  # Custom function to save data
```

Similarly, you can implement a `load_from_storage` function to load the prompt from a storage location using its unique identifier (`id`).

## Getting Started

To use the Swarm Agent, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```

Then, you can initialize and use the agent as follows:

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT

# Initialize the Financial Analysis Agent with GPT-4o-mini model
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True,
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",
    user_name="swarms_corp",
    retry_attempts=1,
    context_length=200000,
    return_step_meta=False,
    output_type="str",
)

# Run the agent
response = agent.run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?"
)
print(response)

```

## Advanced Usage

### Tool Integration

To integrate tools with the Swarm `Agent`, you can pass a list of callable functions with types and doc strings to the `tools` parameter when initializing the `Agent` instance. The agent will automatically convert these functions into an OpenAI function calling schema and make them available for use during task execution.

## Requirements for a tool
- Function
  - With types
  - with doc strings

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
import subprocess

def terminal(code: str):
    """
    Run code in the terminal.

    Args:
        code (str): The code to run in the terminal.

    Returns:
        str: The output of the code.
    """
    out = subprocess.run(code, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True).stdout
    return str(out)

# Initialize the agent with a tool
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Terminal-Agent",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    tools=[terminal],
    system_prompt="You are an agent that can execute terminal commands. Use the tools provided to assist the user.",
)

# Run the agent
response = agent.run("List the contents of the current directory")
print(response)
```

### Long-term Memory Management

The Swarm Agent supports integration with vector databases for long-term memory management. Here's an example using ChromaDB:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import Anthropic
from swarms_memory import ChromaDB

# Initialize ChromaDB
chromadb = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    output_dir="finance_agent_rag",
)

# Initialize the agent with long-term memory
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    llm=Anthropic(anthropic_api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")),
    long_term_memory=chromadb,
    system_prompt="You are a financial analysis agent with access to long-term memory.",
)

# Run the agent
response = agent.run("What are the components of a startup's stock incentive equity plan?")
print(response)
```

### Interactive Mode

To enable interactive mode, set the `interactive` parameter to `True` when initializing the `Agent`:

```python
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Interactive-Agent",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    interactive=True,
    system_prompt="You are an interactive agent. Engage in a conversation with the user.",
)

# Run the agent in interactive mode
agent.run("Let's start a conversation")
```

### Sentiment Analysis

To perform sentiment analysis on the agent's outputs, you can provide a sentiment analyzer function:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def sentiment_analyzer(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    return analysis.sentiment.polarity

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Sentiment-Analysis-Agent",
    llm=OpenAIChat(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    sentiment_analyzer=sentiment_analyzer,
    sentiment_threshold=0.5,
    system_prompt="You are an agent that generates responses with sentiment analysis.",
)

response = agent.run("Generate a positive statement about AI")
print(response)
```



### Undo Functionality

```python
# Feature 2: Undo functionality
response = agent.run("Another task")
print(f"Response: {response}")
previous_state, message = agent.undo_last()
print(message)
```

### Response Filtering

```python
# Feature 3: Response filtering
agent.add_response_filter("report")
response = agent.filtered_run("Generate a report on finance")
print(response)
```

### Saving and Loading State

```python
# Save the agent state
agent.save_state('saved_flow.json')

# Load the agent state
agent = Agent(llm=llm_instance, max_loops=5)
agent.load('saved_flow.json')
agent.run("Continue with the task")
```

### Async and Concurrent Execution

```python
# Run a task concurrently
response = await agent.run_concurrent("Concurrent task")
print(response)

# Run multiple tasks concurrently
tasks = [
    {"task": "Task 1"},
    {"task": "Task 2", "img": "path/to/image.jpg"},
    {"task": "Task 3", "custom_param": 42}
]
responses = agent.bulk_run(tasks)
print(responses)
```


### Various other settings

```python
# # Convert the agent object to a dictionary
print(agent.to_dict())
print(agent.to_toml())
print(agent.model_dump_json())
print(agent.model_dump_yaml())

# Ingest documents into the agent's knowledge base
agent.ingest_docs("your_pdf_path.pdf")

# Receive a message from a user and process it
agent.receive_message(name="agent_name", message="message")

# Send a message from the agent to a user
agent.send_agent_message(agent_name="agent_name", message="message")

# Ingest multiple documents into the agent's knowledge base
agent.ingest_docs("your_pdf_path.pdf", "your_csv_path.csv")

# Run the agent with a filtered system prompt
agent.filtered_run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?"
)

# Run the agent with multiple system prompts
agent.bulk_run(
    [
        "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?",
        "Another system prompt",
    ]
)

# Add a memory to the agent
agent.add_memory("Add a memory to the agent")

# Check the number of available tokens for the agent
agent.check_available_tokens()

# Perform token checks for the agent

## Best Practices

1. Always provide a clear and concise `system_prompt` to guide the agent's behavior.
2. Use `tools` to extend the agent's capabilities for specific tasks.
3. Implement error handling and utilize the `retry_attempts` feature for robust execution.
4. Leverage `long_term_memory` for tasks that require persistent information.
5. Use `interactive` mode for real-time conversations and `dashboard` for monitoring.
6. Implement `sentiment_analysis` for applications requiring tone management.
7. Utilize `autosave` and `save`/`load` methods for continuity across sessions.
8. Optimize token usage with `dynamic_context_window` and `tokens_checks` methods.
9. Use `concurrent` and `async` methods for performance-critical applications.
10. Regularly review and analyze feedback using the `analyze_feedback` method.
11. Use `artifacts_on` to save important outputs from agent execution
12. Configure `device` and `device_id` appropriately for optimal performance
13. Enable `rag_every_loop` when continuous context from long-term memory is needed
14. Use `scheduled_run_date` for automated task scheduling

# `Agent` Documentation

Swarm Agent is a powerful autonomous agent framework designed to connect Language Models (LLMs) with various tools and long-term memory. This class provides the ability to ingest and process various types of documents such as PDFs, text files, Markdown files, JSON files, and more. The Agent structure offers a wide range of features to enhance the capabilities of LLMs and facilitate efficient task execution.

1. **Conversational Loop**: It establishes a conversational loop with a language model. This means it allows you to interact with the model in a back-and-forth manner, taking turns in the conversation.

2. **Feedback Collection**: The class allows users to provide feedback on the responses generated by the model. This feedback can be valuable for training and improving the model's responses over time.

3. **Stoppable Conversation**: You can define custom stopping conditions for the conversation, allowing you to stop the interaction based on specific criteria. For example, you can stop the conversation if a certain keyword is detected in the responses.

4. **Retry Mechanism**: The class includes a retry mechanism that can be helpful if there are issues generating responses from the model. It attempts to generate a response multiple times before raising an error.

## Getting Started

First run the following:

```bash
pip3 install -U swarms
```

And, then now you can get started with the following:

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import (
    FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
)

# Get the OpenAI API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(
    api_key=api_key, model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent_sas_chicken_eej",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True,
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",
    user_name="swarms_corp",
    retry_attempts=1,
    context_length=200000,
    return_step_meta=False,
    output_type="str",
)


agent.run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria"
)
print(out)

```

This example initializes an instance of the `Agent` class with an OpenAI language model and a maximum of 3 loops. The `run()` method is then called with a task to generate a report on financial performance, and the agent's response is printed.

## Advanced Usage

The Swarm Agent provides numerous advanced features and customization options. Here are a few examples of how to leverage these features:

memory = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    n_results=3,
    output_dir="results",
    docs_folder="docs",
)

# Model
model = OpenAIChat(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0.1,
)


# Tools in swarms are simple python functions and docstrings
def terminal(
    code: str,
):
    """
    Run code in the terminal.

    Args:
        code (str): The code to run in the terminal.

    Returns:
        str: The output of the code.

## :material-alert: Current Limitations

!!! warning "Important Limitations"

    ### 🚧 MCPConnection Model
    
    The enhanced connection model is under development:
    
    ```python
    # ❌ Not available yet
    from swarms.schemas.mcp_schemas import MCPConnection
    
    mcp_config = MCPConnection(
        url="http://server:8000/sse",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer token"},
        timeout=30,
        retry_attempts=3
    )
    
    # ✅ Use direct URL instead
    mcp_url = "http://server:8000/sse"
    ```

    ### 🚧 Single Server Limitation
    
    Currently supports one server per agent:
    
    ```python
    # ❌ Multiple servers not supported
    mcp_servers = [
        "http://server1:8000/sse",
        "http://server2:8000/sse"
    ]
    
    # ✅ Single server only
    mcp_url = "http://primary-server:8000/sse"
    ```

    ### 🚧 Sequential Execution
    
    Tools execute sequentially, not in parallel:
    
    ```python
    # Current: tool1() → tool2() → tool3()
    # Future: tool1() | tool2() | tool3() (parallel)
    ```

## Documentation for `rearrange` Function
======================================

The `rearrange` function is a helper function that rearranges the given list of agents based on the specified flow.

## Parameters
----------

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents` | `List[Agent]` | The list of agents to be rearranged. |
| `flow` | `str` | The flow used for rearranging the agents. |
| `task` | `str` (optional) | The task to be performed during rearrangement. Defaults to `None`. |
| `*args` | - | Additional positional arguments. |
| `**kwargs` | - | Additional keyword arguments. |

## Returns
-------

The result of running the agent system with the specified task.

### Example
-------

```python
agents = [agent1, agent2, agent3]
flow = "agent1 -> agent2, agent3"
task = "Perform a task"
rearrange(agents, flow, task)
```

### Example Usage
-------------

Here's an example of how to use the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function:

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange
from typing import List

# Initialize the director agent
director = Agent(
    agent_name="Accounting Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the accounting tasks for the workers",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accounting_director.json",
)

# Initialize worker 1
worker1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Accountant 1",
    system_prompt="Processes financial transactions and prepares financial statements",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant1.json",
)

# Initialize worker 2
worker2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Accountant 2",
    system_prompt="Performs audits and ensures compliance with financial regulations",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant2.json",
)

# Create a list of agents
agents = [director, worker1, worker2]

# Define the flow pattern
flow = "Accounting Director -> Accountant 1 -> Accountant 2"

# Using AgentRearrange class
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)
output = agent_system.run("Process monthly financial statements")
print(output)

```

In this example, we first initialize three agents: `director`, `worker1`, and `worker2`. Then, we create a list of these agents and define the flow pattern `"Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"`.

We can use the `AgentRearrange` class by creating an instance of it with the list of agents and the flow pattern. We then call the `run` method with the initial task, and it will execute the agents in the specified order, passing the output of one agent as the input to the next agent.

Alternatively, we can use the `rearrange` function by passing the list of agents, the flow pattern, and the initial task as arguments.

Both the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function will return the final output after processing the task through the agents according to the specified flow pattern.

## Error Handling
--------------

The `AgentRearrange` class includes error handling mechanisms to validate the flow pattern. If the flow pattern is incorrectly formatted or contains duplicate agent names, a `ValueError` will be raised with an appropriate error message.

### Example:

```python
# Invalid flow pattern
invalid_flow = "Director->Worker1,Worker2->Worker3"
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=invalid_flow)
output = agent_system.run("Some task")`
```

This will raise a `ValueError` with the message `"Agent 'Worker3' is not registered."`.


## Parallel and Sequential Processing
----------------------------------

The `AgentRearrange` class supports both parallel and sequential processing of tasks based on the specified flow pattern. If the flow pattern includes multiple agents separated by commas (e.g., `"agent1, agent2"`), the agents will be executed in parallel, and their outputs will be concatenated with a semicolon (`;`). If the flow pattern includes a single agent, it will be executed sequentially.


### Parallel processing
`parallel_flow = "Worker1, Worker2 -> Director"`

### Sequential processing
`sequential_flow = "Worker1 -> Worker2 -> Director"`

In the `parallel_flow` example, `Worker1` and `Worker2` will be executed in parallel, and their outputs will be concatenated and passed to `Director`. In the `sequential_flow` example, `Worker1` will be executed first, and its output will be passed to `Worker2`, and then the output of `Worker2` will be passed to `Director`.

## Logging
-------

The `AgentRearrange` class includes logging capabilities using the `loguru` library. If `verbose` is set to `True` during initialization, a log file named `agent_rearrange.log` will be created, and log messages will be written to it. You can use this log file to track the execution of the agents and any potential issues or errors that may occur.


```bash
2023-05-08 10:30:15.456 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Director to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.457 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Worker1 to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.457 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Worker2 to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.458 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:run:118 - Running agents in parallel: ['Worker1', 'Worker2']
2023-05-08 10:30:15.459 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:run:121 - Running agents sequentially: ['Director']`
```

## Additional Parameters
---------------------

The `AgentRearrange` class also accepts additional parameters that can be passed to the `run` method using `*args` and `**kwargs`. These parameters will be forwarded to the individual agents during execution.

`agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)`
`output = agent_system.run("Some task", max_tokens=200, temperature=0.7)`

In this example, the `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters will be passed to each agent during execution.

## Customization
-------------

The `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function can be customized and extended to suit specific use cases. For example, you can create custom agents by inheriting from the `Agent` class and implementing custom logic for task processing. You can then add these custom agents to the swarm and define the flow pattern accordingly.

Additionally, you can modify the `run` method of the `AgentRearrange` class to implement custom logic for task processing and agent interaction.


## Limitations
-----------

It's important to note that the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function rely on the individual agents to process tasks correctly. The quality of the output will depend on the capabilities and configurations of the agents used in the swarm. Additionally, the `AgentRearrange` class does not provide any mechanisms for task prioritization or load balancing among the agents.

## Conclusion
----------

The `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function provide a flexible and extensible framework for orchestrating swarms of agents to process tasks based on a specified flow pattern. By combining the capabilities of individual agents, you can create complex workflows and leverage the strengths of different agents to tackle various tasks efficiently.

While the current implementation offers basic functionality for agent rearrangement, there is room for future improvements and customizations to enhance the system's capabilities and cater to more specific use cases.

Whether you're working on natural language processing tasks, data analysis, or any other domain where agent-based systems can be beneficial, the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function provide a solid foundation for building and experimenting with swarm-based solutions.

# swarms.structs Documentation

## Introduction

The swarms.structs library provides a collection of classes for representing artifacts and their attributes. This documentation will provide an overview of the `Artifact` class, its attributes, functionality, and usage examples.

### Artifact Class

The `Artifact` class represents an artifact and its attributes. It inherits from the `BaseModel` class and includes the following attributes:

#### Attributes

1. `artifact_id (str)`: Id of the artifact.
2. `file_name (str)`: Filename of the artifact.
3. `relative_path (str, optional)`: Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace.

These attributes are crucial for identifying and managing different artifacts within a given context.

## Class Definition

The `Artifact` class can be defined as follows:

```python
class Artifact(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents an artifact.

    Attributes:
        artifact_id (str): Id of the artifact.
        file_name (str): Filename of the artifact.
        relative_path (str, optional): Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace.
    """

    artifact_id: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Id of the artifact",
        example="b225e278-8b4c-4f99-a696-8facf19f0e56",
    )
    file_name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Filename of the artifact", example="main.py"
    )
    relative_path: Optional[str] = Field(
        None,
        description=("Relative path of the artifact in the agent's workspace"),
        example="python/code/",
    )
```

The `Artifact` class defines the mandatory and optional attributes and provides corresponding descriptions along with example values.

## Functionality and Usage

The `Artifact` class encapsulates the information and attributes representing an artifact. It provides a structured and organized way to manage artifacts within a given context.

### Example 1: Creating an Artifact instance

To create an instance of the `Artifact` class, you can simply initialize it with the required attributes. Here's an example:

```python
from swarms.structs import Artifact

artifact_instance = Artifact(
    artifact_id="b225e278-8b4c-4f99-a696-8facf19f0e56",
    file_name="main.py",
    relative_path="python/code/",
)
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Artifact` class with the specified artifact details.

### Example 2: Accessing Artifact attributes

You can access the attributes of the `Artifact` instance using dot notation. Here's how you can access the file name of the artifact:

```python
print(artifact_instance.file_name)
# Output: "main.py"
```

### Example 3: Handling optional attributes

If the `relative_path` attribute is not provided during artifact creation, it will default to `None`. Here's an example:

```python
artifact_instance_no_path = Artifact(
    artifact_id="c280s347-9b7d-3c68-m337-7abvf50j23k", file_name="script.js"
)

print(artifact_instance_no_path.relative_path)
# Output: None
```

By providing default values for optional attributes, the `Artifact` class allows flexibility in defining artifact instances.

### Additional Information and Tips

The `Artifact` class represents a powerful and flexible means of handling various artifacts with different attributes. By utilizing this class, users can organize, manage, and streamline their artifacts with ease.

## 1. Class Definition

### Overview

The `Conversation` class is designed to manage conversations by keeping track of messages and their attributes. It offers methods for adding, deleting, updating, querying, and displaying messages within the conversation. Additionally, it supports exporting and importing conversations, searching for specific keywords, and more.

**New in this version**: The class now supports multiple storage backends for persistent conversation storage:

- **"in-memory"**: Default memory-based storage (no persistence)
- **"mem0"**: Memory-based storage with mem0 integration (requires: `pip install mem0ai`)
- **"supabase"**: PostgreSQL-based storage using Supabase (requires: `pip install supabase`)
- **"redis"**: Redis-based storage (requires: `pip install redis`)
- **"sqlite"**: SQLite-based storage (built-in to Python)
- **"duckdb"**: DuckDB-based storage (requires: `pip install duckdb`)
- **"pulsar"**: Apache Pulsar messaging backend (requires: `pip install pulsar-client`)

All backends use **lazy loading** - database dependencies are only imported when the specific backend is instantiated. Each backend provides helpful error messages if required packages are not installed.

```python
# In-memory: Fast, no persistence, good for testing
conv_memory = Conversation(
    backend="in-memory",
    token_count=True,
    message_id_on=True
)

# SQLite: Local file-based persistence, good for single-user apps
conv_sqlite = Conversation(
    backend="sqlite",
    db_path="conversations.db",
    token_count=True,
    export_method="json"
)

# Redis: High performance, good for real-time applications
conv_redis = Conversation(
    backend="redis",
    redis_host="localhost",
    persist_redis=True,
    token_count=True
)

# Supabase: Cloud PostgreSQL, good for multi-user applications
conv_supabase = Conversation(
    backend="supabase", 
    supabase_url=os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL"),
    supabase_key=os.getenv("SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"),
    token_count=True
)

# DuckDB: Analytical workloads, good for data analysis
conv_duckdb = Conversation(
    backend="duckdb",
    db_path="analytics.duckdb",
    token_count=True
)

# Pulsar: Event streaming, good for distributed systems
conv_pulsar = Conversation(
    backend="pulsar",
    token_count=True
)
```

## Error Handling

The conversation class provides graceful error handling:

- **Missing Dependencies**: Clear error messages with installation instructions
- **Backend Failures**: Automatic fallback to in-memory storage
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic and connection management
- **Data Corruption**: Validation and recovery mechanisms

Example error message:
```
Backend 'supabase' dependencies not available. Install with: pip install supabase
```

## Migration Guide

### From Provider to Backend

```python
# Old way
conversation = Conversation(provider="in-memory")

# New way (recommended)
conversation = Conversation(backend="in-memory")

# Both work, but backend takes precedence
conversation = Conversation(
    provider="in-memory",  # Ignored
    backend="supabase"     # Used
)
```

## Conclusion

The `Conversation` class provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing conversations in Python applications with full backend flexibility. It supports various storage backends, lazy loading, token counting, caching, and multiple export/import formats. The class is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases from simple chat applications to complex conversational AI systems with persistent storage requirements.

Choose the appropriate backend based on your needs:
- **in-memory**: Development and testing
- **sqlite**: Local applications and small-scale deployments  
- **redis**: Distributed applications requiring high performance
- **supabase**: Cloud applications with real-time requirements

# CouncilAsAJudge

The `CouncilAsAJudge` is a sophisticated evaluation system that employs multiple AI agents to assess model responses across various dimensions. It provides comprehensive, multi-dimensional analysis of AI model outputs through parallel evaluation and aggregation.

## Overview

The `CouncilAsAJudge` implements a council of specialized AI agents that evaluate different aspects of a model's response. Each agent focuses on a specific dimension of evaluation, and their findings are aggregated into a comprehensive report.

# How to Add a New Swarm Class

This guide provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions for developers to create and add a new swarm. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to best practices, using proper type hints, and documenting code thoroughly to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity in your implementations.

## Overview

A Swarm class enables developers to manage and coordinate multiple agents working together to accomplish complex tasks efficiently. Each Swarm must:

- Contain a `run(task: str, img: str, *args, **kwargs)` method, which serves as the primary execution method for tasks.
- Include `name`, `description`, and `agents` parameters.
- Ensure `agents` is a list of callables, with each callable adhering to specific requirements for dynamic agent behavior.
- Follow type-hinting and documentation best practices to maintain code clarity and reliability.

Each Agent within the swarm must:

- Contain `agent_name`, `system_prompt`, and a `run` method.
- Follow similar type hinting and documentation standards to ensure consistency and readability.

By adhering to these requirements, you can create robust, reusable, and modular swarms that streamline task management and enhance collaborative functionality. Developers are also encouraged to contribute their swarms back to the open-source community by submitting a pull request to the Swarms repository at [https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms).

---

## Creating a Swarm Class

Below is a detailed template for creating a Swarm class. Ensure that all elements are documented and clearly defined:

```python
from typing import Callable, Any, List

class MySwarm:
    """
    A custom swarm class to manage and execute tasks with multiple agents.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the swarm.
        description (str): A brief description of the swarm's purpose.
        agents (List[Callable]): A list of callables representing the agents to be utilized.
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, agents: List[Callable]):
        """
        Initialize the Swarm with its name, description, and agents.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the swarm.
            description (str): A description of the swarm.
            agents (List[Callable]): A list of callables that provide the agents for the swarm.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.agents = agents

    def run(self, task: str, img: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """
        Execute a task using the swarm and its agents.

        Args:
            task (str): The task description.
            img (str): The image input.
            *args: Additional positional arguments for customization.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for fine-tuning behavior.

        Returns:
            Any: The result of the task execution, aggregated from all agents.
        """
        results = []
        for agent in self.agents:
            result = agent.run(task, img, *args, **kwargs)
            results.append(result)
        return results
```

This Swarm class serves as the main orchestrator for coordinating agents and running tasks dynamically and flexibly.

---

## Creating an Agent Class

Each agent must follow a well-defined structure to ensure compatibility with the swarm. Below is an example of an agent class:

```python
class Agent:
    """
    A single agent class to handle specific tasks assigned by the swarm.

    Attributes:
        agent_name (str): The name of the agent.
        system_prompt (str): The system prompt guiding the agent's behavior and purpose.
    """

    def __init__(self, agent_name: str, system_prompt: str):
        """
        Initialize the agent with its name and system prompt.

        Args:
            agent_name (str): The name of the agent.
            system_prompt (str): The guiding prompt for the agent.
        """
        self.agent_name = agent_name
        self.system_prompt = system_prompt

    def run(self, task: str, img: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        """
        Execute a specific task assigned to the agent.

        Args:
            task (str): The task description.
            img (str): The image input for processing.
            *args: Additional positional arguments for task details.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for extended functionality.

        Returns:
            Any: The result of the task execution, which can be customized.
        """
        # Example implementation (to be customized by developer)
        return f"Agent {self.agent_name} executed task: {task}"
```

This structure ensures that each agent can independently handle tasks and integrate seamlessly into a swarm.

---

## Adding Your Swarm to a Project

### Step 1: Define Your Agents
Create one or more instances of the `Agent` class to serve as components of your swarm. For example:

```python
def create_agents():
    return [
        Agent(agent_name="Agent1", system_prompt="Analyze the image and summarize results."),
        Agent(agent_name="Agent2", system_prompt="Detect objects and highlight key features."),
    ]
```

### Step 2: Implement Your Swarm
Create an instance of your Swarm class, defining its name, description, and associated agents:

```python
my_swarm = MySwarm(
    name="Image Analysis Swarm",
    description="A swarm designed to analyze images and perform a range of related tasks.",
    agents=create_agents()
)
```

### Step 3: Execute Tasks
Call the `run` method of your swarm, passing in the required parameters for execution:

```python
results = my_swarm.run(task="Analyze image content", img="path/to/image.jpg")
print(results)
```

This simple flow allows you to dynamically utilize agents for diverse operations and ensures efficient task execution.

---

## Best Practices

To ensure your swarm implementation is efficient and maintainable, follow these best practices:

1. **Type Annotations:**
   Use precise type hints for parameters and return types to improve code readability and support static analysis tools.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation:**
   Include clear and detailed docstrings for all classes, methods, and attributes to ensure your code is understandable.

3. **Thorough Testing:**
   Test your swarm and agents with various tasks to verify correctness and identify potential edge cases.

4. **Modular Design:**
   Keep your swarm and agent logic modular, enabling reuse and easy extensions for future enhancements.

5. **Error Handling:**
   Implement robust error handling in the `run` methods to gracefully manage unexpected inputs or issues during execution.

6. **Code Review:**
   Regularly review and refactor your code to align with the latest best practices and maintain high quality.

7. **Scalability:**
   Design your swarm with scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle a large number of agents and complex tasks.

8. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   Include comprehensive logging to track task execution and monitor performance, enabling easier debugging and optimization.

9. **Open-Source Contributions:**
   Consider contributing your swarm to the Swarms repository to benefit the community. Submit a pull request at [https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms).

---

## Example Output

Given the implementation above, executing a task might produce output such as:

```plaintext
[
    "Agent Agent1 executed task: Analyze image content",
    "Agent Agent2 executed task: Analyze image content"
]
```

The modular design ensures that each agent contributes to the overall functionality of the swarm, allowing seamless scalability and dynamic task management.

---

## Overview of Swarm Architecture

A **Swarm** refers to a collection of agents that collaborate to solve a problem. Each agent in the swarm performs part of the task, either independently or by communicating with other agents. Swarms are ideal for:

- **Scalability**: You can add or remove agents dynamically based on the task's complexity

- **Flexibility**: Each agent can be designed to specialize in different parts of the problem, offering modularity

- **Autonomy**: Agents in a swarm can operate autonomously, reducing the need for constant supervision

- **Conversation Management**: All interactions are tracked and stored for analysis and continuity


---

## Core Requirements for Swarm Classes

Every Swarm class must adhere to these fundamental requirements:

### Required Methods and Attributes

- **`run(task: str, img: str, *args, **kwargs)` method**: The primary execution method for tasks

- **`name`**: A descriptive name for the swarm

- **`description`**: A clear description of the swarm's purpose

- **`agents`**: A list of callables representing the agents

- **`conversation`**: A conversation structure for message storage and history management


### Required Agent Structure

Each Agent within the swarm must contain:

- **`agent_name`**: Unique identifier for the agent

- **`system_prompt`**: Instructions that guide the agent's behavior

- **`run` method**: Method to execute tasks assigned to the agent

### Using Swarms Framework Agents

You can also use the built-in Agent class from the Swarms framework:

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent

def create_financial_agent() -> Agent:
    """Create a financial analysis agent."""
    return Agent(
        agent_name="FinancialAnalyst",
        system_prompt="You are a financial analyst specializing in market analysis and risk assessment.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1,
    )

def create_marketing_agent() -> Agent:
    """Create a marketing analysis agent."""
    return Agent(
        agent_name="MarketingSpecialist", 
        system_prompt="You are a marketing specialist focused on campaign analysis and customer insights.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
        max_loops=1,
    )
```

import time
from typing import List

def create_multi_domain_swarm() -> CustomSwarm:
    """
    Create a comprehensive multi-domain analysis swarm.
    
    Returns:
        CustomSwarm: A configured swarm with multiple specialized agents.

        ),
    ]
    
    # Configure conversation settings
    conversation_config = {
        "backend": "sqlite",  # Use SQLite for persistent storage
        "db_path": f"conversations/swarm_conversations.db",

### Advanced Usage with Concurrent Execution

```python
def run_batch_analysis():
    """Example of running multiple tasks concurrently."""
    swarm = create_multi_domain_swarm()
    
    tasks = [
        "Analyze Q1 financial performance",

        "Review operational efficiency metrics",
        "Assess customer satisfaction trends",
    ]
    
    # Process all tasks concurrently
    all_results = []
    for task in tasks:
        results = swarm.run_concurrent(task)
        all_results.append({"task": task, "results": results})
    
    return all_results
```

## Conversation Management Integration

The swarm uses the Swarms framework's [Conversation structure](../conversation/) for comprehensive message storage and management. This provides:

### Key Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Multiple backend options (SQLite, Redis, Supabase, etc.)

- **Message Categorization**: Organize messages by type (input, output, error, etc.)

- **Token Tracking**: Monitor token usage across conversations

- **Export/Import**: Save and load conversation histories

- **Search Capabilities**: Find specific messages or content


### Conversation Configuration Options

```python
conversation_config = {
    # Backend storage options
    "backend": "sqlite",  # or "redis", "supabase", "duckdb", "in-memory"
    
    # File-based storage
    "db_path": "conversations/swarm_data.db",
    
    # Redis configuration (if using Redis backend)
    "redis_host": "localhost",
    "redis_port": 6379,
    
    # Features
    "time_enabled": True,     # Add timestamps to messages
    "token_count": True,      # Track token usage
    "autosave": True,         # Automatically save conversations
    "save_enabled": True,     # Enable saving functionality
}
```

### Accessing Conversation Data

```python
# Get conversation history
history = swarm.conversation.return_history_as_string()

# Search for specific content
financial_messages = swarm.conversation.search("financial")

# Export conversation data
swarm.conversation.export_conversation("analysis_session.json")

# Get conversation statistics
stats = swarm.conversation.count_messages_by_role()
token_usage = swarm.conversation.export_and_count_categories()
```

For complete documentation on conversation management, see the [Conversation Structure Documentation](../conversation/).

### Creating a Custom Agent Class

Now that we have a solid understanding of the Agent class and its features, let's dive into the process of creating a custom agent class by inheriting from the Agent class. Throughout this process, we'll explore how agents can leverage and extend the existing functionality, while introducing specialized features and capabilities tailored to their unique requirements.

#### Step 1: Inherit from the Agent Class

The first step in creating a custom agent class is to inherit from the Agent class. This will provide your custom agent class with the foundational features and capabilities of the Agent class, which can then be extended and customized as needed. The new agent class must have a `run(task: str)` method to run the entire agent. It is encouraged to have `step(task: str)` method that completes one step of the agent and then build the `run(task: str)` method.

```python

from swarms import Agent

class MyCustomAgent(Agent):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Add custom initialization logic here

    def run(self, task: str) -> 
        ...

```

In the example above, we define a new class `MyCustomAgent` that inherits from the `Agent` class. Within the `__init__` method, we call the parent class's `__init__` method using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, which ensures that the parent class's initialization logic is executed. You can then add any custom initialization logic specific to your custom agent class.

#### Step 2: Customize the Agent's Behavior

One of the key advantages of inheriting from the Agent class is the ability to customize the agent's behavior according to your specific requirements. This can be achieved by overriding or extending the existing methods, or by introducing new methods altogether.

```python
from swarms import Agent


class MyCustomAgent(Agent):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom initialization logic

    def custom_method(self, *args, **kwargs):

        # Implement custom logic here

        pass

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):

        # Customize the run method

        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)

        # Additional custom logic

        return response

```

In the example above, we introduce a new `custom_method` that can encapsulate any specialized logic or functionality specific to your custom agent class. Additionally, we override the `run` method, which is responsible for executing the agent's main task loop. Within the overridden `run` method, you can call the parent class's `run` method using `super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)` and then introduce any additional custom logic before or after the parent method's execution.

#### Step 3: Extend Memory Management

The Agent class provides built-in support for long-term memory, allowing agents to retain and access information from previous interactions. Custom agent classes can inherit and extend this capability by introducing specialized memory management techniques.

```python

from swarms_memory import BaseVectorDatabase
from swarms import Agent


class CustomMemory(BaseVectorDatabase):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom memory initialization logic

    def query(self, *args, **kwargs):

        # Custom memory query logic

        return result

class MyCustomAgent(Agent):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom initialization logic

        self.long_term_memory = CustomMemory()

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):

        # Customize the run method

        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)

        # Utilize custom memory

        memory_result = self.long_term_memory.query(*args, **kwargs)

        # Process memory result

        return response

```

In the example above, we define a new `CustomMemory` class that inherits from the `BaseVectorDatabase` class provided by the Agent class framework. Within the `CustomMemory` class, you can implement specialized memory management logic, such as custom indexing, retrieval, and storage mechanisms.

Next, within the `MyCustomAgent` class, we initialize an instance of the `CustomMemory` class and assign it to the `self.long_term_memory` attribute. This custom memory instance can then be utilized within the overridden `run` method, where you can query the memory and process the results as needed.

## Step 5: Introduce Custom Prompts and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

The Agent class allows you to define custom prompts and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that guide an agent's behavior and decision-making process. Custom agent classes can inherit and extend these prompts and SOPs to align with their unique objectives and requirements.

```python
from swarms import Agent


class MyCustomAgent(Agent):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom initialization logic

        self.custom_sop = "Custom SOP for MyCustomAgent..."

        self.custom_prompt = "Custom prompt for MyCustomAgent..."

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):

        # Customize the run method

        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)

        # Utilize custom prompts and SOPs

        custom_prompt = self.construct_dynamic_prompt(self.custom_prompt)

        custom_sop = self.construct_dynamic_sop(self.custom_sop)

        # Process custom prompts and SOPs

        return response

    def construct_dynamic_prompt(self, prompt):

        # Custom prompt construction logic

        return prompt

    def construct_dynamic_sop(self, sop):

        # Custom SOP construction logic

        return sop

```

In the example above, we define two new attributes within the `MyCustomAgent` class: `custom_sop` and `custom_prompt`. These attributes can be used to store custom prompts and SOPs specific to your custom agent class.

Within the overridden `run` method, you can utilize these custom prompts and SOPs by calling the `construct_dynamic_prompt` and `construct_dynamic_sop` methods, which can be defined within the `MyCustomAgent` class to implement specialized prompt and SOP construction logic.

#### Step 5: Introduce Custom Response Handling

The Agent class provides built-in response filtering capabilities, allowing agents to filter out or replace specific words or phrases in their responses. Custom agent classes can inherit and extend this feature to ensure compliance with content moderation policies or specific guidelines.

```python
from swarms import Agent


class MyCustomAgent(Agent):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Custom initialization logic

        self.response_filters = ["filter_word_1", "filter_word_2"]

    def run(self, task, *args, **kwargs):

        # Customize the run method

        response = super().run(task, *args, **kwargs)

        # Apply custom response filtering

        filtered_response = self.apply_response_filters(response)

        return filtered_response

    def apply_response_filters(self, response):

        # Custom response filtering logic

        for word in self.response_filters:

            response = response.replace(word, "[FILTERED]")

        return response

```

In the example above, we define a new attribute `response_filters` within the `MyCustomAgent` class, which is a list of words or phrases that should be filtered out or replaced in the agent's responses.

Within the overridden `run` method, we call the `apply_response_filters` method, which can be defined within the `MyCustomAgent` class to implement specialized response filtering logic. In the example, we iterate over the `response_filters` list and replace each filtered word or phrase with a placeholder string (`"[FILTERED]"`).

### Advanced Customization and Integration

The Agent class and its inherited custom agent classes can be further extended and customized to suit specific requirements and integrate with external libraries, APIs, and services. Here are some advanced customization and integration examples:

1\. **Multimodal Input/Output Integration**: Custom agent classes can leverage the multimodal input/output capabilities of the Agent class and introduce specialized handling for various data formats such as images, audio, and video.

2\. **Code Execution and Integration**: The Agent class supports code execution, enabling agents to run and evaluate code snippets. Custom agent classes can inherit and extend this capability, introducing specialized code execution environments, sandboxing mechanisms, or integration with external code repositories or platforms.

3\. **External API and Service Integration**: Custom agent classes can integrate with external APIs and services, enabling agents to leverage specialized data sources, computational resources, or domain-specific services.

4\. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the use case and requirements, custom agent classes can introduce performance optimizations, such as adjusting loop intervals, retry attempts, or enabling parallel execution for certain tasks.

5\. **Logging and Monitoring**: Custom agent classes can introduce specialized logging and monitoring mechanisms, enabling agents to track their performance, identify potential issues, and generate detailed reports or dashboards.

6\. **Security and Privacy Enhancements**: Custom agent classes can implement security and privacy enhancements, such as data encryption, access control mechanisms, or compliance with industry-specific regulations and standards.

7\. **Distributed Execution and Scaling**: Custom agent classes can be designed to support distributed execution and scaling, enabling agents to leverage cloud computing resources or distributed computing frameworks for handling large-scale tasks or high-concurrency workloads.

By leveraging these advanced customization and integration capabilities, agents can create highly specialized and sophisticated custom agent classes tailored to their unique requirements and use cases.

### Best Practices and Considerations

While building custom agent classes by inheriting from the Agent class offers immense flexibility and power, it's essential to follow best practices and consider potential challenges and considerations:

1\. **Maintainability and Documentation**: As custom agent classes become more complex, it's crucial to prioritize maintainability and thorough documentation. Clear and concise code, comprehensive comments, and up-to-date documentation can significantly improve the long-term sustainability and collaboration efforts surrounding custom agent classes.

2\. **Testing and Validation**: Custom agent classes should undergo rigorous testing and validation to ensure their correctness, reliability, and adherence to expected behaviors. Establish a robust testing framework and continuously validate the agent's performance, particularly after introducing new features or integrations.

3\. **Security and Privacy Considerations**: When building custom agent classes, it's essential to consider security and privacy implications, especially if the agents will handle sensitive data or interact with critical systems. Implement appropriate security measures, such as access controls, data encryption, and secure communication protocols, to protect against potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

4\. **Scalability and Performance Monitoring**: As custom agent classes are deployed and adopted, it's important to monitor their scalability and performance characteristics. Identify potential bottlenecks, resource constraints, or performance degradation, and implement appropriate optimization strategies or scaling mechanisms to ensure efficient and reliable operation.

5\. **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: Building custom agent classes often involves collaboration among teams and stakeholders. Foster an environment of knowledge sharing, code reviews, and open communication to ensure that everyone involved understands the agent's capabilities, limitations, and intended use cases.

6\. **Ethical Considerations**: As AI agents become more advanced and autonomous, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of their actions and decisions. Implement appropriate safeguards, oversight mechanisms, and ethical guidelines to ensure that custom agent classes operate in a responsible and transparent manner, aligning with ethical principles and societal values.

7\. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: The field of AI is rapidly evolving, with new techniques, tools, and best practices emerging regularly. Stay up-to-date with the latest developments and be prepared to adapt and refine your custom agent classes as new advancements become available.

By following these best practices and considering potential challenges, agents can create robust, reliable, and ethical custom agent classes that meet their specific requirements while adhering to industry standards and best practices.

3. **Run Task**: When a task is submitted, the system traverses through all trees and finds the most relevant agent to handle the task.
4. **Task Execution**: The selected agent processes the task, and the result is returned.

```plaintext
Task: "Our company is incorporated in Delaware, how do we do our taxes for free?"
```

**Process**:
- The system searches through the `Financial Tree` and `Investment Tree`.
- The most relevant agent (likely the "Tax Filing Agent") is selected based on keyword matching and prompt similarity.
- The task is processed, and the result is logged and returned.

---

## Analysis of the Swarm Architecture

The **Swarm Architecture** leverages a hierarchical structure (forest) composed of individual trees, each containing agents specialized in specific domains. This design allows for:

- **Modular and Scalable Organization**: By separating agents into trees, it is easy to expand or contract the system by adding or removing trees or agents.
- **Task Specialization**: Each agent is specialized, which ensures that tasks are matched with the most appropriate agent based on relevance and expertise.
- **Dynamic Matching**: The architecture uses both keyword-based and embedding-based matching to assign tasks, ensuring a high level of accuracy in agent selection.
- **Logging and Accountability**: Each task execution is logged in detail, providing transparency and an audit trail of which agent handled which task and the results produced.
- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: The architecture can be adapted for asynchronous task processing, making it scalable and suitable for large-scale task handling in real-time systems.

### Explanation of the Diagram

- **ForestSwarm**: Represents the top-level structure managing multiple trees.
- **Trees**: In the example, two trees exist—**Financial Tree** and **Investment Tree**—each containing agents related to specific domains.
- **Agents**: Each agent within the tree is responsible for handling tasks in its area of expertise. Agents within a tree are organized based on their prompt similarity (distance).

---

### Summary

This **Multi-Agent Tree Structure** provides an efficient, scalable, and accurate architecture for delegating and executing tasks based on domain-specific expertise. The combination of hierarchical organization, dynamic task matching, and logging ensures reliability, performance, and transparency in task execution.

loaded_workflow = GraphWorkflow.load_from_file(
    filepath,
    restore_runtime_state=True
)

# Continue execution
new_results = loaded_workflow.run("Continue with quantum cryptography analysis")
```

### Advanced Pattern Detection

# HeavySwarm Documentation

HeavySwarm is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that decomposes complex tasks into specialized questions and executes them using four specialized agents: Research, Analysis, Alternatives, and Verification. The results are then synthesized into a comprehensive response.

Inspired by X.AI's Grok 4 heavy implementation, HeavySwarm provides robust task analysis through intelligent question generation, parallel execution, and comprehensive synthesis with real-time progress monitoring.

## Architecture

### System Design

The HeavySwarm follows a structured 5-phase workflow:

1. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into specialized questions
2. **Question Generation**: AI-powered generation of role-specific questions
3. **Parallel Execution**: Four specialized agents work concurrently
4. **Result Collection**: Outputs are gathered and validated
5. **Synthesis**: Integration into a comprehensive final response

### Agent Specialization

- **Research Agent**: Comprehensive information gathering and synthesis
- **Analysis Agent**: Pattern recognition and statistical analysis
- **Alternatives Agent**: Creative problem-solving and strategic options

# Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm [HHCS]

The Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm (HHCS) is an advanced AI orchestration architecture that combines hierarchical decision-making with parallel processing capabilities. HHCS enables complex task solving by dynamically routing tasks to specialized agent swarms based on their expertise and capabilities.

## Purpose

HHCS addresses the challenge of efficiently solving diverse and complex tasks by:

- Intelligently routing tasks to the most appropriate specialized swarms

- Enabling parallel processing of multifaceted problems

- Maintaining a clear hierarchy for effective decision-making

- Combining outputs from multiple specialized agents for comprehensive solutions

## Key Features

- **Router-based task distribution**: Central router agent analyzes incoming tasks and directs them to appropriate specialized swarms

- **Hybrid architecture**: Combines hierarchical control with clustered specialization

- **Parallel processing**: Multiple swarms can work simultaneously on different aspects of complex tasks

- **Flexible swarm types**: Supports both sequential and concurrent workflows within swarms

- **Comprehensive result aggregation**: Collects and combines outputs from all contributing swarms


## Diagram

The HHCS architecture follows a hierarchical structure with the router agent at the top level, specialized swarms at the middle level, and individual agents at the bottom level.

# `HierarchicalSwarm`

The `HierarchicalSwarm` is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that implements a hierarchical workflow pattern. It consists of a director agent that coordinates and distributes tasks to specialized worker agents, creating a structured approach to complex problem-solving.

## Overview

The Hierarchical Swarm follows a clear workflow pattern:

1. **Task Reception**: User provides a task to the swarm
2. **Planning**: Director creates a comprehensive plan and distributes orders to agents
3. **Execution**: Individual agents execute their assigned tasks
4. **Feedback Loop**: Director evaluates results and issues new orders if needed (up to `max_loops`)
5. **Context Preservation**: All conversation history and context is maintained throughout the process

## Architecture

    I --> J[Director Evaluation]
    J --> K{More Loops?}
    K -->|Yes| C
    K -->|No| L[Final Output]
```

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Director agent orchestrates all operations
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple feedback loops for improved results
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Support for various output types (dict, str, list)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Output Types

The `HierarchicalSwarm` supports various output formats through the `output_type` parameter:

| Output Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `"dict-all-except-first"` | Returns all conversation history as a dictionary, excluding the first message | Default format for comprehensive analysis |
| `"dict"` | Returns conversation history as a dictionary | When you need structured data |
| `"str"` | Returns conversation history as a string | For simple text output |
| `"list"` | Returns conversation history as a list | For sequential processing |

## Best Practices

1. **Agent Specialization**: Create agents with specific, well-defined expertise areas
2. **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed, actionable task descriptions
3. **Appropriate Loop Count**: Set `max_loops` based on task complexity (1-3 for most tasks)
4. **Verbose Logging**: Enable verbose mode during development for debugging
5. **Context Preservation**: Leverage the built-in conversation history for continuity
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for production use

## Error Handling

The `HierarchicalSwarm` includes comprehensive error handling with detailed logging. Common issues and solutions:

- **No Agents**: Ensure at least one agent is provided
- **Invalid Director**: Verify the director agent is properly configured
- **Max Loops**: Set `max_loops` to a value greater than 0
- **Model Issues**: Check that all agents have valid model configurations

## Performance Considerations

- **Loop Optimization**: Balance between thoroughness and performance with `max_loops`
- **Agent Count**: More agents increase coordination overhead
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for your use case and budget
- **Verbose Mode**: Disable verbose logging in production for better performance

        "task_name": result,   # Task-specific results
    },
    "processing_time": float   # Processing time in seconds
}
```

## Complete Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Usage with Single Agent

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs import ImageAgentBatchProcessor

# Initialize an agent
agent = Agent(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    model="gpt-4-vision"
)

# Create processor
processor = ImageAgentBatchProcessor(agents=agent)

# Process single image
results = processor.run(
    image_paths="path/to/image.jpg",
    tasks="Describe this image in detail"
)
```

### 2. Processing Multiple Images with Multiple Tasks

```python
# Initialize with multiple agents
agent1 = Agent(api_key="key1", model="gpt-4-vision")
agent2 = Agent(api_key="key2", model="claude-3")

processor = ImageAgentBatchProcessor(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    supported_formats=['.jpg', '.png', '.webp']
)

# Define multiple tasks
tasks = [
    "Describe the main objects in the image",
    "What is the dominant color?",
    "Identify any text in the image"
]

# Process a directory of images
results = processor.run(
    image_paths="path/to/image/directory",
    tasks=tasks
)

# Process results
for result in results:
    print(f"Image: {result['image_path']}")
    for task, output in result['results'].items():
        print(f"Task: {task}")
        print(f"Result: {output}")
    print(f"Processing time: {result['processing_time']:.2f} seconds")
```

### 3. Custom Error Handling

```python
from swarms.structs import ImageAgentBatchProcessor, ImageProcessingError

try:
    processor = ImageAgentBatchProcessor(agents=agent)
    results = processor.run(
        image_paths=["image1.jpg", "image2.png", "invalid.txt"],
        tasks="Analyze the image"
    )
except ImageProcessingError as e:
    print(f"Image processing failed: {e}")
except InvalidAgentError as e:
    print(f"Agent configuration error: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

| Best Practice | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Resource Management | • The processor automatically uses 95% of available CPU cores<br>• For memory-intensive operations, consider reducing `max_workers` |
| Error Handling | • Always wrap processor calls in try-except blocks<br>• Check the results for any error keys |
| Task Design | • Keep tasks focused and specific<br>• Group related tasks together for efficiency |
| Performance Optimization | • Process images in batches for better throughput<br>• Use multiple agents for different types of analysis |

## Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|

### Why Multi-Agent Architectures?

Multi-agent systems unlock new levels of intelligence, reliability, and efficiency by enabling agents to work together. Here are the core benefits:

1. **Reduction of Hallucination**: Cross-verification between agents ensures more accurate, reliable outputs by reducing hallucination.
2. **Extended Memory**: Agents share knowledge and task history, achieving collective long-term memory for smarter, more adaptive responses.
3. **Specialization & Task Distribution**: Delegating tasks to specialized agents boosts efficiency and quality.
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously, greatly increasing speed and throughput.
5. **Scalability & Adaptability**: Systems can dynamically scale and adapt, maintaining efficiency as demands change.

### 🏢 HierarchicalSwarm Example

Hierarchical architectures enable structured, iterative, and scalable problem-solving by combining a director (or router) agent with specialized worker agents or swarms. Below are two key patterns:


```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.hiearchical_swarm import HierarchicalSwarm

# Create specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Research-Specialist",
    agent_description="Expert in market research and analysis",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
)
financial_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst",
    agent_description="Specialist in financial analysis and valuation",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
)

# Initialize the hierarchical swarm
swarm = HierarchicalSwarm(
    name="Financial-Analysis-Swarm",
    description="A hierarchical swarm for comprehensive financial analysis",
    agents=[research_agent, financial_agent],
    max_loops=2,
    verbose=True,
)

# Execute a complex task
result = swarm.run(task="Analyze the market potential for Tesla (TSLA) stock")
print(result)
```

[Full HierarchicalSwarm Documentation →](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/hierarchical_swarm/)



### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one. `SequentialWorkflow` is Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents for a 3-step process
# 1. Generate an idea
idea_generator = Agent(agent_name="IdeaGenerator", system_prompt="Generate a unique startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 2. Validate the idea
validator = Agent(agent_name="Validator", system_prompt="Take this startup idea and analyze its market viability.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 3. Create a pitch
pitch_creator = Agent(agent_name="PitchCreator", system_prompt="Write a 3-sentence elevator pitch for this validated startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[idea_generator, validator, pitch_creator])

# Run the workflow
elevator_pitch = workflow.run()
print(elevator_pitch)
```

### ConcurrentWorkflow (with `SpreadSheetSwarm`)

A concurrent workflow runs multiple agents simultaneously. `SpreadSheetSwarm` is a powerful implementation that can manage thousands of concurrent agents and log their outputs to a CSV file. Use this architecture for high-throughput tasks that can be performed in parallel, drastically reducing execution time.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SpreadSheetSwarm

# Define a list of tasks (e.g., social media posts to generate)
platforms = ["Twitter", "LinkedIn", "Instagram"]

# Create an agent for each task
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name=f"{platform}-Marketer",
        system_prompt=f"Generate a real estate marketing post for {platform}.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    for platform in platforms
]

# Initialize the swarm to run these agents concurrently
swarm = SpreadSheetSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    autosave_on=True,
    save_file_path="marketing_posts.csv",
)

# Run the swarm with a single, shared task description
property_description = "A beautiful 3-bedroom house in sunny California."
swarm.run(task=f"Generate a post about: {property_description}")
# Check marketing_posts.csv for the results!
```

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax. [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is Perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, sequence, or a combination of both.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the system
# The researcher will generate content, and then both the writer and editor
# will process that content in parallel.
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```

---

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm. Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

This makes your code cleaner and more flexible, allowing you to switch between different multi-agent strategies with ease. Here's a complete example that shows how to define agents and then use `SwarmRouter` to execute the same task using different collaborative strategies.

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```


The `SwarmRouter` is a powerful tool for simplifying multi-agent orchestration. It provides a consistent and flexible way to deploy different collaborative strategies, allowing you to build more sophisticated applications with less code.

---

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result. [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

---

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically. This architecture is ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```

## Speaker Functions

InteractiveGroupChat supports various speaker functions that control the order in which agents respond when multiple agents are mentioned.

### Built-in Speaker Functions

#### Round Robin Speaker (`round_robin_speaker`)

Agents speak in a fixed order, cycling through the list in sequence.

```python
from swarms.structs.interactive_groupchat import InteractiveGroupChat, round_robin_speaker

chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=round_robin_speaker,
    interactive=False,
)
```

**Behavior:**

- Agents speak in the order they were mentioned

- Maintains state between calls to continue the cycle

- Predictable and fair distribution of speaking turns

#### Random Speaker (`random_speaker`)

Agents speak in random order each time.

```python
from swarms.structs.interactive_groupchat import InteractiveGroupChat, random_speaker

chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=random_speaker,
    interactive=False,
)
```

**Behavior:**

- Speaking order is randomized for each task

- Provides variety and prevents bias toward first-mentioned agents

- Good for brainstorming sessions

#### Priority Speaker (`priority_speaker`)

Agents speak based on priority weights assigned to each agent.

```python
from swarms.structs.interactive_groupchat import InteractiveGroupChat, priority_speaker

chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=priority_speaker,
    speaker_state={"priorities": {"financial_advisor": 3, "tax_expert": 2, "analyst": 1}},
    interactive=False,
)
```

**Behavior:**

- Higher priority agents speak first

- Uses weighted probability for selection

- Good for hierarchical teams or expert-led discussions

#### Random Dynamic Speaker (`random_dynamic_speaker`)

Advanced speaker function that follows @mentions in agent responses, enabling dynamic conversation flow.

```python
from swarms.structs.interactive_groupchat import InteractiveGroupChat, random_dynamic_speaker

chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=random_dynamic_speaker,
    speaker_state={"strategy": "parallel"},  # or "sequential"
    interactive=False,
)
```

**Behavior:**

- **First Call**: Randomly selects an agent to start the conversation
- **Subsequent Calls**: Extracts @mentions from the previous agent's response and selects the next speaker(s)
- **Two Strategies**:
  - **Sequential**: Processes one agent at a time based on @mentions
  - **Parallel**: Processes all mentioned agents simultaneously

**Example Dynamic Flow:**
```python
# Agent A responds: "I think @AgentB should analyze this data and @AgentC should review the methodology"
# With sequential strategy: Agent B speaks next
# With parallel strategy: Both Agent B and Agent C speak simultaneously
```

**Use Cases:**
- Complex problem-solving where agents need to delegate to specific experts
- Dynamic workflows where the conversation flow depends on agent responses
- Collaborative decision-making processes

### Custom Speaker Functions

You can create your own speaker functions to implement custom logic:

```python
def custom_speaker(agents: List[str], **kwargs) -> str:
    """
    Custom speaker function that selects agents based on specific criteria.
    
    Args:
        agents: List of agent names
        **kwargs: Additional arguments (context, time, etc.)
        
    Returns:
        Selected agent name
    """
    # Your custom logic here
    if "urgent" in kwargs.get("context", ""):
        return "emergency_agent" if "emergency_agent" in agents else agents[0]
    
    # Default to first agent
    return agents[0]

# Use custom speaker function
chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=custom_speaker,
    interactive=False,
)
```

### Dynamic Speaker Function Changes

You can change the speaker function during runtime:

```python
# Start with round robin
chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
    agents=agents,
    speaker_function=round_robin_speaker,
    interactive=False,
)

# Change to random
chat.set_speaker_function(random_speaker)

# Change to priority with custom priorities
chat.set_priorities({"financial_advisor": 5, "tax_expert": 3, "analyst": 1})
chat.set_speaker_function(priority_speaker)

# Change to dynamic speaker with parallel strategy
chat.set_speaker_function("random-dynamic-speaker")
chat.set_dynamic_strategy("parallel")
```

## Enhanced Collaborative Behavior

The InteractiveGroupChat now includes enhanced collaborative prompts that ensure agents work together effectively.

### Collaborative Response Protocol

Every agent receives instructions to:

1. **Read and understand** all previous responses from other agents
2. **Acknowledge** what other agents have said
3. **Build upon** previous insights rather than repeating information
4. **Synthesize** multiple perspectives when possible
5. **Delegate** appropriately using @mentions

### Response Structure

Agents are guided to structure their responses as:

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "I've reviewed the responses from @agent1 and @agent2..."
2. **BUILD**: "Building on @agent1's analysis of the data..."
3. **CONTRIBUTE**: "From my perspective, I would add..."
4. **COLLABORATE**: "To get a complete picture, let me ask @agent3 to..."
5. **SYNTHESIZE**: "Combining our insights, the key findings are..."

### Example Collaborative Response

```python
task = "Analyze our Q3 performance. @analyst @researcher @strategist"

# Expected collaborative behavior:
# Analyst: "Based on the data analysis, I can see clear growth trends in Q3..."
# Researcher: "Building on @analyst's data insights, I can add that market research shows..."
# Strategist: "Synthesizing @analyst's data and @researcher's market insights, I recommend..."
```

## Error Classes

### InteractiveGroupChatError

**Description:**  

Base exception class for InteractiveGroupChat errors.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    # Some operation that might fail
    chat.run("@InvalidAgent hello")
except InteractiveGroupChatError as e:
    print(f"Chat error occurred: {e}")
```

### AgentNotFoundError

**Description:**  

Raised when a mentioned agent is not found in the group.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    chat.run("@NonExistentAgent hello!")
except AgentNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Agent not found: {e}")
```

### NoMentionedAgentsError

**Description:**  

Raised when no agents are mentioned in the task.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    chat.run("Hello everyone!")  # No @mentions
except NoMentionedAgentsError as e:
    print(f"No agents mentioned: {e}")
```

### InvalidTaskFormatError

**Description:**  

Raised when the task format is invalid.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    chat.run("@Invalid@Format")
except InvalidTaskFormatError as e:
    print(f"Invalid task format: {e}")
```

### InvalidSpeakerFunctionError

**Description:**  

Raised when an invalid speaker function is provided.

**Example:**
```python
def invalid_speaker(agents, **kwargs):
    return 123  # Should return string, not int

try:
    chat = InteractiveGroupChat(
        agents=agents,
        speaker_function=invalid_speaker,
    )
except InvalidSpeakerFunctionError as e:
    print(f"Invalid speaker function: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

| Best Practice | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Agent Naming | Use clear, unique names for agents to avoid confusion | `financial_advisor`, `tax_expert` |
| Task Format | Always use @mentions to direct tasks to specific agents | `@financial_advisor What's your investment advice?` |
| Speaker Functions | Choose appropriate speaker functions for your use case | Round robin for fairness, priority for expert-led discussions |
| Dynamic Speaker | Use random-dynamic-speaker for complex workflows with delegation | When agents need to call on specific experts |
| Strategy Selection | Choose sequential for focused discussions, parallel for brainstorming | Sequential for analysis, parallel for idea generation |
| Collaborative Design | Design agents with complementary expertise for better collaboration | Analyst + Researcher + Strategist |
| Error Handling | Implement proper error handling for various scenarios | `try/except` blocks for `AgentNotFoundError` |
| Context Management | Be aware that agents can see the full conversation history | Monitor conversation length and relevance |
| Resource Management | Consider the number of agents and task length to optimize performance | Limit max_loops and task size |
| Dynamic Adaptation | Change speaker functions based on different phases of work | Round robin for brainstorming, priority for decision-making |

# MajorityVoting Module Documentation

The `MajorityVoting` module provides a mechanism for performing majority voting among a group of agents. Majority voting is a decision rule that selects the option which has the majority of votes. This is particularly useful in systems where multiple agents provide responses to a query, and the most common response needs to be identified as the final output.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MajorityVoting System] --> B[Initialize Agents]
    B --> C[Process Task]
    C --> D{Execution Mode}
    D --> E[Single Task]
    D --> F[Batch Tasks]
    D --> G[Concurrent Tasks]
    D --> H[Async Tasks]
    E --> I[Run Agents]
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J[Collect Responses]
    J --> K[Consensus Analysis]
    K --> L{Consensus Agent?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Use Consensus Agent]
    L -->|No| N[Use Last Agent]
    M --> O[Final Output]
    N --> O
    O --> P[Save Conversation]
```

### Key Concepts

- **Majority Voting**: A method to determine the most common response from a set of answers.
- **Agents**: Entities (e.g., models, algorithms) that provide responses to tasks or queries.
- **Output Parser**: A function that processes the responses from the agents before performing the majority voting.
- **Consensus Agent**: An optional agent that analyzes the responses from all agents to determine the final consensus.
- **Conversation History**: A record of all agent interactions and responses during the voting process.

# MALT: Multi-Agent Learning Task Framework

## Overview

MALT (Multi-Agent Learning Task) is a sophisticated orchestration framework that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to tackle complex tasks through structured conversations. Inspired by the principles outlined in the [MALT research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01928), this implementation provides a reliable, extensible system for multi-agent collaboration.

The framework is designed around a three-agent architecture:

1. **Creator Agent**: Generates initial content or solutions

2. **Verifier Agent**: Critically evaluates the creator's output

3. **Refiner Agent**: Improves the solution based on verifier feedback

This collaborative approach enables high-quality outputs for complex tasks by combining the strengths of multiple specialized agents, each focused on a different aspect of the problem-solving process.

## How It Works

The MALT framework follows a structured workflow:

1. A task is submitted to the system
2. The Creator Agent generates an initial solution
3. Multiple instances of the Verifier Agent independently evaluate the solution
4. Multiple instances of the Refiner Agent improve the solution based on verification feedback
5. The final refined output is returned

This process can be configured to run for multiple iterations, with each cycle potentially improving the quality of the output. The system maintains a conversation history, tracking interactions between agents throughout the workflow.

### Key Components

- **Agent**: Represents an individual AI agent with specific capabilities and responsibilities
- **Conversation**: Manages the interaction history between agents
- **MALT Orchestrator**: Coordinates the workflow and manages agent interactions
- **Concurrency Support**: Enables parallel execution of multiple agent instances

## Sample Implementations

### Default Mathematical Proof Agents

The MALT framework includes preset agents specialized for mathematical proof generation and refinement:

1. **Proof Creator Agent**: Generates original mathematical theorems and proofs
2. **Proof Verifier Agent**: Critically evaluates and identifies issues in mathematical proofs
3. **Proof Refiner Agent**: Improves proofs based on verification feedback

Each agent has a carefully designed system prompt that guides its behavior and specialization.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.structs.multi_agent_exec import MALT

# Initialize with preset mathematical proof agents
malt = MALT(preset_agents=True)

# Run a mathematical proof task
result = malt.run("Develop a theorem and proof related to prime numbers and their distribution.")

print(result)
```

### Custom Agents

```python
from swarms.structs.agent import Agent
from swarms.structs.multi_agent_exec import MALT

# Define custom agents
creator = Agent(
    agent_name="Physics-Creator",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    system_prompt="You are a theoretical physicist specializing in quantum mechanics..."
)

verifier = Agent(
    agent_name="Physics-Verifier",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    system_prompt="You are an experimental physicist who verifies theoretical claims..."
)

refiner = Agent(
    agent_name="Physics-Communicator",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    system_prompt="You excel at explaining complex physics concepts to diverse audiences..."
)

# Initialize MALT with custom agents
malt = MALT(
    main_agent=creator,
    verifier_agent=verifier,
    refiner_agent=refiner,
    preset_agents=False,
    max_loops=1
)

# Run a physics explanation task
result = malt.run("Explain the quantum entanglement phenomenon and its implications.")
```

### Concurrent Processing

```python
from swarms.structs.multi_agent_exec import MALT

# Initialize MALT
malt = MALT()

# Define multiple tasks
tasks = [
    "Prove a theorem related to continuous functions on compact sets.",
    "Develop a theorem about convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.",
    "Create a theorem relating to measure theory and Lebesgue integration."
]

# Process tasks concurrently
futures = malt.run_concurrently(tasks)

# Collect results as they complete
for future in futures:
    result = future.result()
    print(result)
```

## Example: Complex Mathematical Domain

Here's an example of how MALT can generate, verify, and refine a mathematical proof:

### Input

```python
malt = MALT(preset_agents=True)
task = "Develop a theorem and rigorous proof related to the convergence properties of infinite series."
result = malt.run(task)
```

### Output Flow

1. **Creator Agent** generates a theorem and proof about conditions for absolute convergence
2. **Verifier Agents** identify issues:
   - Logical gap in lemma 2
   - Missing justification for uniform convergence claim
   - Imprecise definition of certain terms
3. **Refiner Agents** produce improved versions addressing these concerns
4. The final output contains the refined, rigorous mathematical proof

## Best Practices

1. **Task Specificity**: Provide clear, detailed task descriptions for optimal results
2. **Agent Specialization**: Design agent prompts to focus on specific aspects of the task
3. **Iteration Control**: Adjust `max_loops` based on task complexity
4. **Concurrent Verification**: Use multiple verifier instances for comprehensive evaluation
5. **Custom Agents**: Create domain-specific agents for specialized tasks

## Potential Improvements

- Autonomously create specialized agents based on task requirements
- Implement feedback loops between agents for iterative improvement
- Add support for agent-specific memory and knowledge bases
- Expand concurrency capabilities for improved performance
- Implement learning mechanisms for agent improvement over time

agents = [
    [
        Agent(
            agent_name=f"Agent-{i}-{j}",
            system_prompt="Your system prompt here",
            model_name="gpt-4",
            max_loops=1,
            verbose=True
        ) for j in range(2)
    ] for i in range(2)
]

# Initialize matrix
matrix = MatrixSwarm(agents)

# Example operations
transposed = matrix.transpose()
scaled = matrix.scalar_multiply(2)

# Run operations with inputs
inputs = ["Query 1", "Query 2"]
results = matrix.multiply(transposed, inputs)

# Save results
matrix.save_to_file("matrix_results.json")
```

## Output Schema

The `AgentOutput` class defines the structure for operation results:

```python
class AgentOutput(BaseModel):
    agent_name: str
    input_query: str
    output_result: Any
    metadata: dict
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialization**
   - Ensure all agents in the matrix are properly configured before initialization
   - Validate matrix dimensions for your use case

2. **Operation Performance**
   - Consider computational costs for large matrices
   - Use appropriate batch sizes for inputs

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for agent operations
   - Validate inputs before matrix operations

4. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor agent resource usage in large matrices
   - Implement proper cleanup procedures

## Limitations

- Matrix operations are constrained by the underlying agent capabilities
- Performance may vary based on agent configuration and complexity
- Resource usage scales with matrix dimensions

## Overview

The `MixtureOfAgents` class represents a mixture of agents operating within a swarm. The workflow of the swarm follows a parallel → sequential → parallel → final output agent process. This implementation is inspired by concepts discussed in the paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04692](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04692).

The class is designed to manage a collection of agents, orchestrate their execution in layers, and handle the final aggregation of their outputs through a designated final agent. This architecture facilitates complex, multi-step processing where intermediate results are refined through successive layers of agent interactions.

## Detailed Explanation

### Initialization

The `__init__` method initializes the swarm with the provided parameters, sets up the conversation rules, and invokes the initialization of the swarm. It also ensures the validity of the `agents` and `final_agent` attributes by calling the `agent_check` and `final_agent_check` methods respectively.

### Agent Validation

The `agent_check` method validates whether the `agents` attribute is a list of `Agent` instances, while the `final_agent_check` method validates whether the `final_agent` is an instance of `Agent`. These checks are crucial to ensure that the swarm operates correctly with the appropriate agent types.

### Swarm Initialization

The `swarm_initialization` method logs essential information about the swarm, including its name, description, and the number of agents. This provides a clear starting point for the swarm's operations and facilitates debugging and monitoring.

### Running the Swarm

The `run` method is the core of the `MixtureOfAgents` class. It orchestrates the execution of agents through multiple layers, collects their outputs, and processes the final output using the `final_agent`. The conversation history is maintained and updated throughout this process, allowing for a seamless flow of information and responses.

During each layer, the method iterates over the agents, invokes their `run` method with the current conversation history, and logs the outputs. These outputs are then added to the conversation, and the history is updated for the next layer.

After all layers are completed, the final output agent processes the entire conversation history, and the metadata is created and optionally saved to a file. This metadata includes details about the layers, agent runs, and final output, providing a comprehensive record of the swarm's execution.

## Additional Information and Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Type Errors**: Ensure that all agents in the `agents` list and the `final_agent` are instances of the `Agent` class. The `agent_check` and `final_agent_check` methods help validate this.
- **Verbose Logging**: Use the `verbose` flag to control the verbosity of the output. This can help with debugging or reduce clutter in the logs.
- **Auto-Save Feature**: Utilize the `auto_save` flag to automatically save the metadata to a file. This can be useful for keeping records of the swarm's operations without manual intervention.

    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the tasks for the accountants",
    llm=OpenAIChat(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",

    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant1.json",
)

accountant2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Accountant2",
    system_prompt="Audits financial records",
    llm=OpenAIChat(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant2.json",
)

# Initialize MixtureOfAgents
moe_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[director, accountant1, accountant2],
    final_agent=director
)

# Process multiple tasks in batch
tasks = [
    "Analyze Q1 financial statements",
    "Review tax compliance",
    "Prepare budget forecast"
]
results = moe_swarm.run_batched(tasks)
for task, result in zip(tasks, results):
    print(f"Task: {task}\nResult: {result}\n")
```

### Example 5: Concurrent Processing

```python
from swarms import MixtureOfAgents, Agent
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat

# Initialize agents as before
# ... agent initialization code ...

# Initialize MixtureOfAgents
moe_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[director, accountant1, accountant2],
    final_agent=director
)

# Process multiple tasks concurrently
tasks = [
    "Generate monthly report",
    "Audit expense claims",
    "Update financial projections",
    "Review investment portfolio"
]
results = moe_swarm.run_concurrently(tasks)
for task, result in zip(tasks, results):
    print(f"Task: {task}\nResult: {result}\n")
```

## Advanced Features

### Context Preservation

The `MixtureOfAgents` class maintains context between iterations when running multiple loops. Each subsequent iteration receives the context from previous runs, allowing for more sophisticated and context-aware processing.

# Multi-Agent Examples


### `SequentialWorkflow`
Sequential Workflow enables you to sequentially execute tasks with `Agent` and then pass the output into the next agent and onwards until you have specified your max loops.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

from swarm_models import Anthropic


# Initialize the language model agent (e.g., GPT-3)
llm = Anthropic()

# Initialize agents for individual tasks
agent1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Blog generator",
    system_prompt="Generate a blog post like stephen king",
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    tools=[],
)
agent2 = Agent(
    agent_name="summarizer",
    system_prompt="Sumamrize the blog post",
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    tools=[],
)

# Create the Sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
    agents=[agent1, agent2], max_loops=1, verbose=False
)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run(
    "Generate a blog post on how swarms of agents can help businesses grow."
)

```

## `AgentRearrange`
Inspired by Einops and einsum, this orchestration techniques enables you to map out the relationships between various agents. For example you specify linear and sequential relationships like `a -> a1 -> a2 -> a3` or concurrent relationships where the first agent will send a message to 3 agents all at once: `a -> a1, a2, a3`. You can customize your workflow to mix sequential and concurrent relationships. [Docs Available:](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange


from swarm_models import Anthropic

# Initialize the director agent

director = Agent(
    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the tasks for the workers",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="director.json",
)


# Initialize worker 1

worker1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker1",
    system_prompt="Generates a transcript for a youtube video on what swarms are",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker1.json",
)


# Initialize worker 2
worker2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker2",
    system_prompt="Summarizes the transcript generated by Worker1",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker2.json",
)


# Create a list of agents
agents = [director, worker1, worker2]

# Define the flow pattern
flow = "Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"

# Using AgentRearrange class
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)
output = agent_system.run(
    "Create a format to express and communicate swarms of llms in a structured manner for youtube"
)
print(output)

## `MixtureOfAgents`
This is an implementation from the paper: "Mixture-of-Agents Enhances Large Language Model Capabilities" by together.ai, it achieves SOTA on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. Great for tasks that need to be parallelized and then sequentially fed into another loop

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat, MixtureOfAgents

# Initialize the director agent
director = Agent(
    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the tasks for the accountants",
    llm=OpenAIChat(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="director.json",
)

# Initialize accountant 1
accountant1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Accountant1",
    system_prompt="Prepares financial statements",
    llm=OpenAIChat(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant1.json",
)

# Initialize accountant 2
accountant2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Accountant2",
    system_prompt="Audits financial records",
    llm=OpenAIChat(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="accountant2.json",
)

# Create a list of agents
agents = [director, accountant1, accountant2]


# Swarm
swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    name="Mixture of Accountants",
    agents=agents,
    layers=3,
    final_agent=director,
)


# Run the swarm
out = swarm.run("Prepare financial statements and audit financial records")
print(out)
```

# Multi-Agent Orchestration:
Swarms was designed to faciliate the communication between many different and specialized agents from a vast array of other frameworks such as langchain, autogen, crew, and more.

In traditional swarm theory, there are many types of swarms usually for very specialized use-cases and problem sets. Such as Hiearchical and sequential are great for accounting and sales, because there is usually a boss coordinator agent that distributes a workload to other specialized agents.

    Analyze for:
    1. Key terms and conditions
    2. Potential risks and liabilities
    3. Compliance with current regulations
    4. Suggested modifications"""
)
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

1. Always use try-except blocks for task routing:
```python
try:
    result = router.route_task(task)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Task routing failed: {str(e)}")
```

2. Monitor agent performance:
```python
if result["execution"]["execution_time"] > 5.0:
    logger.warning(f"Long execution time for task: {result['task']['original']}")
```

3. Implement rate limiting for concurrent tasks:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    results = router.concurrent_batch_run(tasks)
```

4. Regular agent validation:
```python
for agent in router.agents.values():
    if not agent.validate():
        logger.error(f"Agent validation failed: {agent.name}")
```

## Performance Considerations

1. Task Batching

- Group similar tasks together

- Use concurrent_batch_run for independent tasks

- Monitor memory usage with large batches

2. Model Selection

- Choose appropriate models based on task complexity

- Balance speed vs. accuracy requirements

- Error rates

- Resource utilization

2. Logging

- Use structured logging

- Implement log rotation

- Regular log analysis

3. Alerts

- Set up alerting for critical errors

- Monitor resource usage

- Track API rate limits

# Hierarchical Agent Orchestration Architectures

Hierarchical agent orchestration involves organizing multiple agents in structured layers to efficiently handle complex tasks. There are several key architectures available, each with distinct characteristics and use cases.

Here are the Hierarchical swarms we support:

| Architecture | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| HHCS | - Clear task routing<br>- Specialized swarm handling<br>- Parallel processing capability<br>- Good for complex multi-domain tasks | - More complex setup<br>- Overhead in routing<br>- Requires careful swarm design |
| Auto Agent Builder | - Dynamic agent creation<br>- Flexible scaling<br>- Self-organizing<br>- Good for evolving tasks | - Higher resource usage<br>- Potential creation overhead<br>- May create redundant agents |
| SwarmRouter | - Multiple workflow types<br>- Simple configuration<br>- Flexible deployment<br>- Good for varied task types | - Less specialized than HHCS<br>- Limited inter-swarm communication<br>- May require manual type selection |



## Core Architectures

### 1. Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm (HHCS)

Hybrid Hierarchical-Cluster Swarm (HHCS) is architecture that uses a Router Agent to analyze and distribute tasks to other swarms.

- Tasks are routed to specialized swarms based on their requirements

- Enables parallel processing through multiple specialized swarms

- Ideal for complex, multi-domain tasks and enterprise-scale operations

- Provides clear task routing but requires more complex setup

    RouterAgent --> Analysis{Task Analysis}
    
    Analysis -->|Analyze Requirements| Selection[Swarm Selection]
    Selection -->|Select Best Swarm| Route[Route Task]
    
    Route --> Swarm1[Specialized Swarm 1]
    Route --> Swarm2[Specialized Swarm 2]
    Route --> SwarmN[Specialized Swarm N]
    
    Swarm1 -->|Process| Result1[Output 1]
    Swarm2 -->|Process| Result2[Output 2]
    SwarmN -->|Process| ResultN[Output N]
    
    Result1 --> Final[Final Output]
    Result2 --> Final
    ResultN --> Final
```

### 2. Auto Agent Builder

Auto Agent Builder is a dynamic agent architecture that creates specialized agents on-demand.

- Analyzes tasks and automatically builds appropriate agents for the job

- Maintains an agent pool that feeds into task orchestration

- Best suited for evolving requirements and dynamic workloads

- Self-organizing but may have higher resource usage

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Task[Task Input] --> Builder[Agent Builder]
    Builder --> Analysis{Task Analysis}
    
    Analysis --> Create[Create Specialized Agents]
    Create --> Pool[Agent Pool]
    
    Pool --> Agent1[Specialized Agent 1]
    Pool --> Agent2[Specialized Agent 2]
    Pool --> AgentN[Specialized Agent N]
    
    Agent1 --> Orchestration[Task Orchestration]
    Agent2 --> Orchestration
    AgentN --> Orchestration
    
    Orchestration --> Result[Final Result]
```

### 3. SwarmRouter


SwarmRouter is a flexible system supporting multiple swarm architectures through a simple interface:

- Sequential workflows

- Concurrent workflows

- Hierarchical swarms

- Group chat interactions

- Simpler to configure and deploy compared to other architectures

- Best for general-purpose tasks and smaller scale operations

- Recommended for 5-20 agents.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Input[Task Input] --> Router[Swarm Router]
    Router --> TypeSelect{Swarm Type Selection}
    
    TypeSelect -->|Sequential| Seq[Sequential Workflow]
    TypeSelect -->|Concurrent| Con[Concurrent Workflow]

# File: swarms\structs\multi_threaded_workflow.md

# MultiThreadedWorkflow Documentation

The `MultiThreadedWorkflow` class represents a multi-threaded workflow designed to execute tasks concurrently using a thread pool. This class is highly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be executed in parallel to improve performance and efficiency. The workflow ensures that tasks are managed in a priority-based queue, and it includes mechanisms for retrying failed tasks and optionally saving task results automatically.

## Class Definition

### `MultiThreadedWorkflow`

| Parameter     | Type                  | Default | Description                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_workers` | `int`                 | `5`     | The maximum number of worker threads in the thread pool.      |
| `autosave`    | `bool`                | `True`  | Flag indicating whether to automatically save task results.   |
| `tasks`       | `List[PriorityTask]`  | `None`  | List of priority tasks to be executed.                        |
| `retry_attempts` | `int`             | `3`     | The maximum number of retry attempts for failed tasks.        |
| `*args`       | `tuple`               |         | Variable length argument list.                                |
| `**kwargs`    | `dict`                |         | Arbitrary keyword arguments.                                  |

## Attributes

| Attribute        | Type               | Description                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_workers`    | `int`              | The maximum number of worker threads in the thread pool.       |
| `autosave`       | `bool`             | Flag indicating whether to automatically save task results.    |
| `retry_attempts` | `int`              | The maximum number of retry attempts for failed tasks.         |
| `tasks_queue`    | `PriorityQueue`    | The queue that holds the priority tasks.                       |
| `lock`           | `Lock`             | The lock used for thread synchronization.                      |

## Methods

### `run`


#### Description

The `run` method executes the tasks stored in the priority queue using a thread pool. It handles task completion, retries failed tasks up to a specified number of attempts, and optionally saves the results of tasks if the autosave flag is set.

#### Usage Example

```python
from swarms import MultiThreadedWorkflow, PriorityTask, Task

# Define some tasks
tasks = [PriorityTask(task=Task()), PriorityTask(task=Task())]

# Create a MultiThreadedWorkflow instance
workflow = MultiThreadedWorkflow(max_workers=3, autosave=True, tasks=tasks, retry_attempts=2)

# Run the workflow
results = workflow.run()
print(results)
```

### `_autosave_task_result`

#### Description

The `_autosave_task_result` method is responsible for saving the results of a task. It uses a thread lock to ensure that the autosave operation is thread-safe.

#### Usage Example

This method is intended for internal use and is typically called by the `run` method. However, here is an example of how it might be used directly:

```python
# Create a task and result
task = Task()
result = task.run()

# Autosave the result
workflow = MultiThreadedWorkflow()
workflow._autosave_task_result(task, result)
```

## Detailed Functionality and Usage

### Initialization

When an instance of `MultiThreadedWorkflow` is created, it initializes the following:

- **max_workers**: Sets the maximum number of threads that can run concurrently.
- **autosave**: Determines if the task results should be saved automatically.
- **tasks**: Accepts a list of tasks that need to be executed. If no tasks are provided, an empty list is used.
- **retry_attempts**: Sets the maximum number of retry attempts for failed tasks.
- **tasks_queue**: A priority queue to manage tasks based on their priority.
- **lock**: A threading lock to ensure thread-safe operations.

### Running Tasks

The `run` method performs the following steps:

1. **Initialize Results and Executor**: Creates a list to store results and a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage the threads.
2. **Submit Tasks**: Iterates over the tasks in the queue, submitting them to the executor for execution and storing the future objects.
3. **Monitor Completion**: Uses the `wait` function to monitor the completion of tasks. Once a task is completed, it retrieves the result or catches exceptions.
4. **Retry Mechanism**: If a task fails, it checks the number of attempts made and retries the task if the limit is not reached.
5. **Autosave**: If the `autosave` flag is set, the `_autosave_task_result` method is called to save the task results.

### Autosave Task Result

The `_autosave_task_result` method handles the saving of task results. It uses a threading lock to ensure that the save operation is not interrupted by other threads.

## Additional Information and Tips

- **Thread Safety**: The use of threading locks ensures that the operations are thread-safe, preventing race conditions.
- **Logging**: The class uses the logging module to log information about task completion, retries, and failures.
- **Error Handling**: The retry mechanism helps in handling transient errors by attempting to re-execute failed tasks.

# RoundRobin: Round-Robin Task Execution in a Swarm

## Introduction

The `RoundRobinSwarm` class is designed to manage and execute tasks among multiple agents in a round-robin fashion. This approach ensures that each agent in a swarm receives an equal opportunity to execute tasks, which promotes fairness and efficiency in distributed systems. It is particularly useful in environments where collaborative, sequential task execution is needed among various agents.

## Conceptual Overview

### What is Round-Robin?

Round-robin is a scheduling technique commonly used in computing for managing processes in shared systems. It involves assigning a fixed time slot to each process and cycling through all processes in a circular order without prioritization. In the context of swarms of agents, this method ensures equitable distribution of tasks and resource usage among all agents.

### Application in Swarms

In swarms, `RoundRobinSwarm` utilizes the round-robin scheduling to manage tasks among agents like software components, autonomous robots, or virtual entities. This strategy is beneficial where tasks are interdependent or require sequential processing.

## Class Attributes

- `agents (List[Agent])`: List of agents participating in the swarm.
- `verbose (bool)`: Enables or disables detailed logging of swarm operations.
- `max_loops (int)`: Limits the number of times the swarm cycles through all agents.
- `index (int)`: Maintains the current position in the agent list to ensure round-robin execution.

## Methods

### `__init__`

Initializes the swarm with the provided list of agents, verbosity setting, and operational parameters.

**Parameters:**
- `agents`: Optional list of agents in the swarm.
- `verbose`: Boolean flag for detailed logging.
- `max_loops`: Maximum number of execution cycles.
- `callback`: Optional function called after each loop.

### `run`

Executes a specified task across all agents in a round-robin manner, cycling through each agent repeatedly for the number of specified loops.

**Conceptual Behavior:**
- Distribute the task sequentially among all agents starting from the current index.
- Each agent processes the task and potentially modifies it or produces new output.
- After an agent completes its part of the task, the index moves to the next agent.
- This cycle continues until the specified maximum number of loops is completed.
- Optionally, a callback function can be invoked after each loop to handle intermediate results or perform additional actions.

## Examples
### Example 1: Load Balancing Among Servers

In this example, `RoundRobinSwarm` is used to distribute network requests evenly among a group of servers. This is common in scenarios where load balancing is crucial for maintaining system responsiveness and scalability.

```python
from swarms import Agent, RoundRobinSwarm

    verbose=True,
    streaming_on=True,
    context_length=1000,
)

# Initialize the swarm with sales agents
sales_swarm = RoundRobinSwarm(agents=[sales_agent1, sales_agent2, sales_agent3], verbose=True)

# Define a sales task
task = "Generate a sales email for an accountant firm executive to sell swarms of agents to automate their accounting processes."

# Distribute sales tasks to different agents
for _ in range(5):  # Repeat the task 5 times
    results = sales_swarm.run(task)
    print("Sales generated:", results)
```



## Conclusion

The RoundRobinSwarm class provides a robust and flexible framework for managing tasks among multiple agents in a fair and efficient manner. This class is especially useful in environments where tasks need to be distributed evenly among a group of agents, ensuring that all tasks are handled timely and effectively. Through the round-robin algorithm, each agent in the swarm is guaranteed an equal opportunity to contribute to the overall task, promoting efficiency and collaboration.

# SequentialWorkflow Documentation

**Overview:**
A Sequential Swarm architecture processes tasks in a linear sequence. Each agent completes its task before passing the result to the next agent in the chain. This architecture ensures orderly processing and is useful when tasks have dependencies. [Learn more here in the docs:](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/)

**Use-Cases:**

- Workflows where each step depends on the previous one, such as assembly lines or sequential data processing.

- Scenarios requiring strict order of operations.

## Attributes

| Attribute        | Type          | Description                                      |
|------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `agents`         | `List[Agent]` | The list of agents in the workflow.              |
| `flow`           | `str`         | A string representing the order of agents.       |
| `agent_rearrange`| `AgentRearrange` | Manages the dynamic execution of agents.        |

## Methods

### `__init__(self, agents: List[Agent] = None, max_loops: int = 1, *args, **kwargs)`

The constructor initializes the `SequentialWorkflow` object.

- **Parameters:**
  - `agents` (`List[Agent]`, optional): The list of agents in the workflow. Defaults to `None`.
  - `max_loops` (`int`, optional): The maximum number of loops to execute the workflow. Defaults to `1`.
  - `*args`: Variable length argument list.
  - `**kwargs`: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

### `run(self, task: str) -> str`

Runs the specified task through the agents in the dynamically constructed flow.

- **Parameters:**
  - `task` (`str`): The task for the agents to execute.

- **Returns:**
  - `str`: The final result after processing through all agents.

## **Usage Example:**

```python

from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents for individual tasks
agent1 = Agent(
  agent_name="ICD-10 Code Analyzer",
  system_prompt="Analyze medical data and provide relevant ICD-10 codes.",
  model_name="gpt-4o",
  max_loops=1,
)
agent2 = Agent(
  agent_name="ICD-10 Code Summarizer",
  system_prompt="Summarize the findings and suggest ICD-10 codes.",
  model_name="gpt-4o",
  max_loops=1,
)

# Create the Sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
  agents=[agent1, agent2], max_loops=1, verbose=False
)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run(
  "Analyze the medical report and provide the appropriate ICD-10 codes."
)

```

This example initializes a `SequentialWorkflow` with three agents and executes a task, printing the final result.

##  **Notes:**

- Logs the task execution process and handles any exceptions that occur during the task execution.

### Logging and Error Handling

The `run` method includes logging to track the execution flow and captures errors to provide detailed information in case of failures. This is crucial for debugging and ensuring smooth operation of the workflow.

## Additional Tips

- Ensure that the agents provided to the `SequentialWorkflow` are properly initialized and configured to handle the tasks they will receive.

- The `max_loops` parameter can be used to control how many times the workflow should be executed, which is useful for iterative processes.

- Utilize the logging information to monitor and debug the task execution process.

## Additional Information and Tips

- **Thread Synchronization**: When working with multiple agents in a concurrent environment, it's crucial to ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized using locks to avoid race conditions.

- **Autosave Feature**: If you enable the `autosave_on` flag, ensure that the file path provided is correct and writable. This feature is handy for long-running tasks where you want to periodically save the state.

- **Error Handling**

: Implementing proper error handling within your agents can prevent the swarm from crashing during execution. Consider catching exceptions in the `run` method and logging errors appropriately.

- **Custom Agents**: You can extend the `Agent` class to create custom agents that perform specific tasks tailored to your application's needs.

# SwarmMatcher

SwarmMatcher is a tool for automatically matching tasks to the most appropriate swarm type based on their semantic similarity.

## Overview

The SwarmMatcher utilizes transformer-based embeddings to determine the best swarm architecture for a given task. By analyzing the semantic meaning of task descriptions and comparing them to known swarm types, it can intelligently select the optimal swarm configuration for any task.

## Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Task Description] --> B[Generate Task Embedding]
    C[Swarm Type Descriptions] --> D[Generate Swarm Type Embeddings]
    B --> E[Calculate Similarity Scores]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Select Best Matching Swarm Type]
    F --> G[Return Selected Swarm Type]
    
    subgraph Initialization
        H[Define Swarm Types] --> I[Load Transformer Model]
        I --> J[Pre-compute Swarm Type Embeddings]
    end
    
    subgraph Matching Process
        A --> B --> E --> F --> G
    end
```

## Installation

SwarmMatcher is included in the Swarms package. To use it, simply import it from the library:

```python
from swarms.structs.swarm_matcher import SwarmMatcher, SwarmMatcherConfig, SwarmType
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from swarms.structs.swarm_matcher import swarm_matcher

# Use the simplified function to match a task to a swarm type
swarm_type = swarm_matcher("Analyze this dataset and create visualizations")
print(f"Selected swarm type: {swarm_type}")
```

## Advanced Usage

For more control over the matching process, you can create and configure your own SwarmMatcher instance:

```python
from swarms.structs.swarm_matcher import SwarmMatcher, SwarmMatcherConfig, SwarmType, initialize_swarm_types

# Create a configuration
config = SwarmMatcherConfig(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    embedding_dim=512
)

# Initialize the matcher
matcher = SwarmMatcher(config)

# Add default swarm types
initialize_swarm_types(matcher)

# Add a custom swarm type
custom_swarm = SwarmType(
    name="CustomSwarm",
    description="A specialized swarm for handling specific domain tasks with expert knowledge."
)
matcher.add_swarm_type(custom_swarm)

# Find the best match for a task
best_match, score = matcher.find_best_match("Process natural language and extract key insights")
print(f"Best match: {best_match}, Score: {score}")

# Auto-select a swarm type
selected_swarm = matcher.auto_select_swarm("Create data visualizations from this CSV file")
print(f"Selected swarm: {selected_swarm}")
```

## Available Swarm Types

```python
from swarms.structs.swarm_matcher import swarm_matcher

# Match tasks to swarm types
tasks = [
    "Analyze this dataset and create visualizations",
    "Coordinate multiple agents to tackle different aspects of a problem",
    "Process these 10 PDF files in sequence",
    "Handle these data processing tasks in parallel"
]

for task in tasks:
    swarm_type = swarm_matcher(task)
    print(f"Task: {task}")
    print(f"Selected swarm: {swarm_type}\n")
```

### Custom Swarm Types

```python
from swarms.structs.swarm_matcher import SwarmMatcher, SwarmMatcherConfig, SwarmType

# Create configuration and matcher
config = SwarmMatcherConfig()
matcher = SwarmMatcher(config)

# Define custom swarm types
swarm_types = [
    SwarmType(
        name="DataAnalysisSwarm",
        description="Specialized in processing and analyzing large datasets, performing statistical analysis, and extracting insights from complex data."
    ),
    SwarmType(
        name="CreativeWritingSwarm",
        description="Optimized for creative content generation, storytelling, and producing engaging written material with consistent style and tone."
    ),
    SwarmType(
        name="ResearchSwarm",
        description="Focused on deep research tasks, synthesizing information from multiple sources, and producing comprehensive reports on complex topics."
    )
]

# Add swarm types
for swarm_type in swarm_types:
    matcher.add_swarm_type(swarm_type)

# Save the swarm types for future use
matcher.save_swarm_types("custom_swarm_types.json")

# Use the matcher
task = "Research quantum computing advances in the last 5 years"
best_match = matcher.auto_select_swarm(task)
print(f"Selected swarm type: {best_match}")
```

## How It Works

SwarmMatcher uses a transformer-based model to generate embeddings (vector representations) of both the task descriptions and the swarm type descriptions. It then calculates the similarity between these embeddings to determine which swarm type is most semantically similar to the given task.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SwarmMatcher
    participant TransformerModel
    
    User->>SwarmMatcher: task = "Analyze this dataset"
    Note over SwarmMatcher: Initialization already complete
    
    SwarmMatcher->>TransformerModel: get_embedding(task)
    TransformerModel-->>SwarmMatcher: task_embedding
    
    loop For each swarm type
        SwarmMatcher->>SwarmMatcher: Calculate similarity score
        Note over SwarmMatcher: score = dot_product(task_embedding, swarm_type.embedding)
    end
    
    SwarmMatcher->>SwarmMatcher: Find best score
    SwarmMatcher-->>User: "SpreadSheetSwarm"
```

The matching process follows these steps:

1. The task description is converted to an embedding vector
2. Each swarm type's description is converted to an embedding vector
3. The similarity between the task embedding and each swarm type embedding is calculated
4. The swarm type with the highest similarity score is selected

This approach ensures that the matcher can understand the semantic meaning of tasks, not just keyword matching, resulting in more accurate swarm type selection.

# SwarmNetwork [WIP]

The `SwarmNetwork` class is a powerful tool for managing a pool of agents, orchestrating task distribution, and scaling resources based on workload. It is designed to handle tasks efficiently by dynamically adjusting the number of agents according to the current demand. This class also provides an optional API for interacting with the agent pool, making it accessible for integration with other systems.

### Key Features
- **Agent Pool Management**: Dynamically manage a pool of agents.
- **Task Queue Management**: Handle tasks through a queue system.
- **Agent Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health of agents.
- **Agent Pool Scaling**: Scale the agent pool up or down based on workload.
- **API**: Interact with the agent pool and task queue through a simple API.
- **Agent Deployment Options**: Run agents on threads, processes, containers, machines, or clusters.

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from the environment
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAIChat(
    temperature=0.5,
    openai_api_key=api_key,
)

## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1, agent_name="Social Media Manager")
agent2 = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1, agent_name=" Product Manager")
agent3 = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=1, agent_name="SEO Manager")


# Load the swarmnet with the agents
swarmnet = SwarmNetwork(
    agents=[agent, agent2, agent3],
)

# List the agents in the swarm network
out = swarmnet.list_agents()
print(out)

# Run the workflow on a task
out = swarmnet.run_single_agent(
    agent2.id, "Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness."
)
print(out)


# Run all the agents in the swarm network on a task
out = swarmnet.run_many_agents("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.")
print(out)
```

## Additional Information and Tips

- **Error Handling**: Make use of try-except blocks to handle potential errors when adding tasks, running tasks, and managing agents.
- **Logging**: Enable logging to track the activity and status of the swarm network.
- **API**: The provided API allows for easy interaction with the swarm network and can be extended as needed.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize the asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations, especially in a production environment.
- **Scaling**: Adjust the scaling thresholds (`idle_threshold` and `busy_threshold`) based on the specific needs and workload patterns.

# SwarmRearrange Documentation

SwarmRearrange is a class for orchestrating multiple swarms in a sequential or parallel flow pattern. It provides thread-safe operations for managing swarm execution, history tracking, and flow validation.

## Constructor Arguments

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| id | str | UUID | Unique identifier for the swarm arrangement |
| name | str | "SwarmRearrange" | Name of the swarm arrangement |
| description | str | "A swarm of swarms..." | Description of the arrangement |
| swarms | List[Any] | [] | List of swarm objects to be managed |
| flow | str | None | Flow pattern for swarm execution |
| max_loops | int | 1 | Maximum number of execution loops |
| verbose | bool | True | Enable detailed logging |
| human_in_the_loop | bool | False | Enable human intervention |
| custom_human_in_the_loop | Callable | None | Custom function for human interaction |
| return_json | bool | False | Return results in JSON format |

## Methods

### add_swarm(swarm: Any)
Adds a single swarm to the arrangement.

### remove_swarm(swarm_name: str) 
Removes a swarm by name from the arrangement.

### add_swarms(swarms: List[Any])
Adds multiple swarms to the arrangement.

### validate_flow()
Validates the flow pattern syntax and swarm names.

### run(task: str = None, img: str = None, custom_tasks: Dict[str, str] = None)
Executes the swarm arrangement according to the flow pattern.

## Flow Pattern Syntax
The flow pattern uses arrow notation (`->`) to define execution order:

- Sequential: `"SwarmA -> SwarmB -> SwarmC"`
- Parallel: `"SwarmA, SwarmB -> SwarmC"`
- Human intervention: Use `"H"` in the flow

## Examples

### Complex Multi-Stage Pipeline

```python
# Define multiple flow patterns
flows = [
    "Collector -> Processor -> Analyzer",
    "Analyzer -> ML -> Validator",
    "Validator -> Reporter"
]

# Create arrangements for each flow
pipelines = [
    SwarmRearrange(name=f"Pipeline{i}", swarms=swarms, flow=flow)
    for i, flow in enumerate(flows)
]

# Create master arrangement
master = SwarmRearrange(
    name="MasterPipeline",
    swarms=pipelines,
    flow="Pipeline0 -> Pipeline1 -> Pipeline2"
)

# Execute complete pipeline
result = master.run("Start analysis")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Flow Validation**: Always validate flows before execution
2. **Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks around run() calls
3. **History Tracking**: Use track_history() for monitoring swarm execution
4. **Resource Management**: Set appropriate max_loops to prevent infinite execution
5. **Logging**: Enable verbose mode during development for detailed logging

## Error Handling

The class implements comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    arrangement = SwarmRearrange(swarms=swarms, flow=flow)
    result = arrangement.run(task)
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Flow validation error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Execution error: {e}")
```

  - `**kwargs`: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

### `add_task(self, task: str)`

Adds a task to the queue.

- **Parameters:**
  - `task` (`str`): The task to be added to the queue.

### `run(self)`

Runs the swarm by having agents pick up tasks from the queue.

- **Returns:**
  - `str`: JSON string of the swarm run metadata if `return_metadata_on` is True.

- **Usage Example:**
  ```python
  from swarms import Agent, TaskQueueSwarm


  # Initialize agents
  agent1 = Agent(agent_name="Agent1", model_name="gpt-4o")
  agent2 = Agent(agent_name="Agent2", model_name="gpt-4o")

  # Create the TaskQueueSwarm
  swarm = TaskQueueSwarm(agents=[agent1, agent2], max_loops=5)

  # Add tasks to the swarm
  swarm.add_task("Analyze the latest market trends")
  swarm.add_task("Generate a summary report")

  # Run the swarm
  result = swarm.run()
  print(result)  # Prints the swarm run metadata
  ```

  This example initializes a `TaskQueueSwarm` with two agents, adds tasks to the queue, and runs the swarm.

### `save_json_to_file(self)`

Saves the swarm run metadata to a JSON file.

### `export_metadata(self)`

Exports the swarm run metadata as a JSON string.

## Additional Notes

- The `TaskQueueSwarm` uses threading to process tasks concurrently, which can significantly improve performance for I/O-bound tasks.
- The `reliability_checks` method ensures that the swarm is properly configured before running.
- The swarm automatically handles task distribution among agents and provides detailed metadata about the run.
- Error handling and logging are implemented to track the execution flow and capture any issues during task processing.

# YamlModel: A Pydantic Model for YAML Data

The `YamlModel` class, derived from `BaseModel` in Pydantic, offers a convenient way to work with YAML data in your Python applications. It provides methods for serialization (converting to YAML), deserialization (creating an instance from YAML), and schema generation. This documentation will delve into the functionalities of `YamlModel` and guide you through its usage with illustrative examples.

### Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of `YamlModel` is to streamline the interaction between your Python code and YAML data. It accomplishes this by:

* **Serialization:** Transforming a `YamlModel` instance into a YAML string representation using the `to_yaml()` method.
* **Deserialization:** Constructing a `YamlModel` instance from a provided YAML string using the `from_yaml()` class method.
* **JSON to YAML Conversion:** Facilitating the conversion of JSON data to YAML format through the `json_to_yaml()` static method.
* **Saving to YAML File:** Enabling the storage of `YamlModel` instances as YAML files using the `save_to_yaml()` method.
* (Future Implementation) **Schema Generation:** The `create_yaml_schema()` class method (not yet implemented but included for future reference) will generate a YAML schema that reflects the structure of the `YamlModel` class and its fields.

### Class Definition and Arguments

The `YamlModel` class inherits from Pydantic's `BaseModel` class. You can define your custom YAML models by creating subclasses of `YamlModel` and specifying your data fields within the class definition. Here's the breakdown of the `YamlModel` class and its methods:

```python
class YamlModel(BaseModel):
    """
    A Pydantic model class for working with YAML data.
    """

    def to_yaml(self):
        """
        Serialize the Pydantic model instance to a YAML string.
        """
        return yaml.safe_dump(self.dict(), sort_keys=False)

    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, yaml_str: str):
        """
        Create an instance of the class from a YAML string.

        Args:
            yaml_str (str): The YAML string to parse.

        Returns:
            cls: An instance of the class with attributes populated from the YAML data.
                 Returns None if there was an error loading the YAML data.
        """
        # ...

    @staticmethod
    def json_to_yaml(json_str: str):
        """
        Convert a JSON string to a YAML string.
        """
        # ...

    def save_to_yaml(self, filename: str):
        """
        Save the Pydantic model instance as a YAML file.
        """
        # ...

    # TODO: Implement a method to create a YAML schema from the model fields
    # @classmethod
    # def create_yaml_schema(cls):
    #     # ...
    """
```

**Arguments:**

* `self` (implicit): Refers to the current instance of the `YamlModel` class.
* `yaml_str` (str): The YAML string used for deserialization in the `from_yaml()` method.
* `json_str` (str): The JSON string used for conversion to YAML in the `json_to_yaml()` method.
* `filename` (str): The filename (including path) for saving the YAML model instance in the `save_to_yaml()` method.

### Detailed Method Descriptions

**1. to_yaml()**

This method transforms an instance of the `YamlModel` class into a YAML string representation. It utilizes the `yaml.safe_dump()` function from the `PyYAML` library to ensure secure YAML data generation. The `sort_keys=False` argument guarantees that the order of keys in the resulting YAML string remains consistent with the order of fields defined in your `YamlModel` subclass.

**Example:**

```python
class User(YamlModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    is_active: bool

user = User(name="Bob", age=30, is_active=True)
yaml_string = user.to_yaml()
print(yaml_string)
```

This code will output a YAML string representation of the `user` object, resembling:

```yaml
name: Bob
age: 30
is_active: true
```

### Detailed Method Descriptions 

**2. from_yaml(cls, yaml_str)** (Class Method)

The `from_yaml()` class method is responsible for constructing a `YamlModel` instance from a provided YAML string. 

* **Arguments:**
    * `cls` (class): The class representing the desired YAML model (the subclass of `YamlModel` that matches the structure of the YAML data).
    * `yaml_str` (str): The YAML string containing the data to be parsed and used for creating the model instance.

* **Returns:**
    * `cls` (instance): An instance of the specified class (`cls`) populated with the data extracted from the YAML string. If an error occurs during parsing, it returns `None`.

* **Error Handling:**

The `from_yaml()` method employs `yaml.safe_load()` for secure YAML parsing. It incorporates a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions that might arise during the parsing process. If an error is encountered, it logs the error message and returns `None`.

**Example:**

```python
class User(YamlModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    is_active: bool

yaml_string = """
name: Alice
age: 25
is_active: false
"""

user = User.from_yaml(yaml_string)
print(user.name)  # Output: Alice
```

**3. json_to_yaml(json_str)** (Static Method)

This static method in the `YamlModel` class serves the purpose of converting a JSON string into a YAML string representation.

* **Arguments:**
    * `json_str` (str): The JSON string that needs to be converted to YAML format.

* **Returns:**
    * `str`: The converted YAML string representation of the provided JSON data.

* **Functionality:**

The `json_to_yaml()` method leverages the `json.loads()` function to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary. Subsequently, it utilizes `yaml.dump()` to generate the corresponding YAML string representation from the parsed dictionary.

**Example:**

```python
json_string = '{"name": "Charlie", "age": 42, "is_active": true}'
yaml_string = YamlModel.json_to_yaml(json_string)
print(yaml_string)
```

This code snippet will convert the JSON data to a YAML string, likely resembling:

```yaml
name: Charlie
age: 42
is_active: true
```

**4. save_to_yaml(self, filename)**

The `save_to_yaml()` method facilitates the storage of a `YamlModel` instance as a YAML file.

* **Arguments:**
    * `self` (implicit): Refers to the current instance of the `YamlModel` class that you intend to save.
    * `filename` (str): The desired filename (including path) for the YAML file.

* **Functionality:**

The `save_to_yaml()` method employs the previously explained `to_yaml()` method to generate a YAML string representation of the `self` instance. It then opens the specified file in write mode (`"w"`) and writes the YAML string content to the file.

**Example:**

```python
class Employee(YamlModel):
    name: str
    department: str
    salary: float

employee = Employee(name="David", department="Engineering", salary=95000.00)
employee.save_to_yaml("employee.yaml")
```

This code will create a YAML file named "employee.yaml" containing the serialized representation of the `employee` object.


### More Usage Examples ++ 

```python
class User(YamlModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    is_active: bool

# Create an instance of the User model
user = User(name="Alice", age=30, is_active=True)

# Serialize the User instance to YAML and print it
yaml_string = user.to_yaml()
print(yaml_string)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a `User` instance and its subsequent serialization to a YAML string using the `to_yaml()` method. The printed output will likely resemble:

```yaml
name: Alice
age: 30
is_active: true
```

### Converting JSON to YAML

```python
# Convert JSON string to YAML and print
json_string = '{"name": "Bob", "age": 25, "is_active": false}'
yaml_string = YamlModel.json_to_yaml(json_string)
print(yaml_string)
```

This example showcases the conversion of a JSON string containing user data into a YAML string representation using the `json_to_yaml()` static method. The resulting YAML string might look like:

```yaml
name: Bob
age: 25
is_active: false
```

### Saving User Instance to YAML File

```python
# Save the User instance to a YAML file
user.save_to_yaml("user.yaml")
```

This code demonstrates the utilization of the `save_to_yaml()` method to store the `user` instance as a YAML file named "user.yaml". The contents of the file will mirror the serialized YAML string representation of the user object.

## Additional Considerations

* Ensure you have the `PyYAML` library installed (`pip install pyyaml`) to leverage the YAML parsing and serialization functionalities within `YamlModel`.
* Remember that the `create_yaml_schema()` method is not yet implemented but serves as a placeholder for future enhancements.
* For complex data structures within your YAML models, consider leveraging Pydantic's data validation and nested model capabilities for robust data management.

## Conclusion

The `YamlModel` class in Pydantic offers a streamlined approach to working with YAML data in your Python projects. By employing the provided methods (`to_yaml()`, `from_yaml()`, `json_to_yaml()`, and `save_to_yaml()`), you can efficiently convert between Python objects and YAML representations, facilitating data persistence and exchange. This comprehensive documentation empowers you to effectively utilize `YamlModel` for your YAML data processing requirements.

## Exception Classes

The BaseTool class defines several custom exception classes for better error handling:

- `BaseToolError`: Base exception class for all BaseTool related errors

- `ToolValidationError`: Raised when tool validation fails

- `ToolExecutionError`: Raised when tool execution fails

- `ToolNotFoundError`: Raised when a requested tool is not found

- `FunctionSchemaError`: Raised when function schema conversion fails

- `ToolDocumentationError`: Raised when tool documentation is missing or invalid

- `ToolTypeHintError`: Raised when tool type hints are missing or invalid

## Usage Tips

1. **Always provide documentation and type hints** for your functions when using BaseTool
2. **Use verbose=True** during development for detailed logging
3. **Set up function_map** for efficient tool execution by name
4. **Validate schemas** before using them with different AI providers
5. **Use parallel execution** for better performance when executing multiple functions
6. **Handle exceptions** appropriately using the custom exception classes

# Swarms Tool Documentation

A tool is a Python function designed to perform specific tasks with clear type annotations and comprehensive docstrings. Below are examples of financial tools to help you get started.

## Rules

To create a tool in the Swarms environment, follow these rules:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The tool must be defined as a Python function.
   - The function should perform a specific task and be named appropriately.

2. **Type Annotations**: 
   - All arguments and the return value must have type annotations.
   - Both input and output types must be strings (`str`).

3. **Docstrings**: 
   - Each function must include a comprehensive docstring that adheres to PEP 257 standards. The docstring should explain:
     - The purpose of the function.
     - Arguments: names, types, and descriptions.
     - Return value: type and description.
     - Potential exceptions that the function may raise.

4. **Input and Output Types**:
   - The function's input must be a string.
   - The function's output must be a string.

## Example Financial Tools

# The Swarms Tool System: Functions, Pydantic BaseModels as Tools, and Radical Customization


This guide provides an in-depth look at the Swarms Tool System, focusing on its functions, the use of Pydantic BaseModels as tools, and the extensive customization options available. Aimed at developers, this documentation highlights how the Swarms framework works and offers detailed examples of creating and customizing tools and agents, specifically for accounting tasks.

The Swarms Tool System is a flexible and extensible component of the Swarms framework that allows for the creation, registration, and utilization of various tools. These tools can perform a wide range of tasks and are integrated into agents to provide specific functionalities. The system supports multiple ways to define tools, including using Pydantic BaseModels, functions, and dictionaries.

### Architecture

The architecture of the Swarms Tool System is designed to be highly modular. It consists of the following main components:

1. **Agents:** The primary entities that execute tasks.
2. **Tools:** Functions or classes that perform specific operations.
3. **Schemas:** Definitions of input and output data formats using Pydantic BaseModels.

### Key Concepts

#### Tools

Tools are the core functional units within the Swarms framework. They can be defined in various ways:

- **Pydantic BaseModels**: Tools can be defined using Pydantic BaseModels to ensure data validation and serialization.
- **Functions**: Tools can be simple or complex functions.
- **Dictionaries**: Tools can be represented as dictionaries for flexibility.

#### Agents

Agents utilize tools to perform tasks. They are configured with a set of tools and schemas, and they execute the tools based on the input they receive.

## Detailed Documentation

### Tool Definition

#### Using Pydantic BaseModels

Pydantic BaseModels provide a structured way to define tool inputs and outputs. They ensure data validation and serialization, making them ideal for complex data handling.

**Example:**

Define Pydantic BaseModels for accounting tasks:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CalculateTax(BaseModel):
    income: float

class GenerateInvoice(BaseModel):
    client_name: str
    amount: float
    date: str

class SummarizeExpenses(BaseModel):
    expenses: list[dict]
```

Define tool functions using these models:

```python
def calculate_tax(data: CalculateTax) -> dict:
    tax_rate = 0.3  # Example tax rate
    tax = data.income * tax_rate
    return {"income": data.income, "tax": tax}

def generate_invoice(data: GenerateInvoice) -> dict:
    invoice = {
        "client_name": data.client_name,
        "amount": data.amount,
        "date": data.date,
        "invoice_id": "INV12345"
    }
    return invoice

def summarize_expenses(data: SummarizeExpenses) -> dict:
    total_expenses = sum(expense['amount'] for expense in data.expenses)
    return {"total_expenses": total_expenses}
```

#### Using Functions Directly

Tools can also be defined directly as functions without using Pydantic models. This approach is suitable for simpler tasks where complex validation is not required.

**Example:**

```python
def basic_tax_calculation(income: float) -> dict:
    tax_rate = 0.25
    tax = income * tax_rate
    return {"income": income, "tax": tax}
```

#### Using Dictionaries

Tools can be represented as dictionaries, providing maximum flexibility. This method is useful when the tool's functionality is more dynamic or when integrating with external systems.

**Example:**

```python
basic_tool_schema = {
    "name": "basic_tax_tool",
    "description": "A basic tax calculation tool",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "income": {"type": "number", "description": "Income amount"}
        },
        "required": ["income"]
    }
}

def basic_tax_tool(income: float) -> dict:
    tax_rate = 0.2
    tax = income * tax_rate
    return {"income": income, "tax": tax}
```

### Tool Registration

Tools need to be registered with the agent for it to utilize them. This can be done by specifying the tools in the `tools` parameter during agent initialization.

**Example:**

```python
from swarms import Agent
from llama_hosted import llama3Hosted

# Define Pydantic BaseModels for accounting tasks
class CalculateTax(BaseModel):
    income: float

class GenerateInvoice(BaseModel):
    client_name: str
    amount: float
    date: str

class SummarizeExpenses(BaseModel):
    expenses: list[dict]

# Define tool functions using these models
def calculate_tax(data: CalculateTax) -> dict:
    tax_rate = 0.3
    tax = data.income * tax_rate
    return {"income": data.income, "tax": tax}

def generate_invoice(data: GenerateInvoice) -> dict:
    invoice = {
        "client_name": data.client_name,
        "amount": data.amount,
        "date": data.date,
        "invoice_id": "INV12345"
    }
    return invoice

def summarize_expenses(data: SummarizeExpenses) -> dict:
    total_expenses = sum(expense['amount'] for expense in data.expenses)
    return {"total_expenses": total_expenses}

# Function to generate a tool schema for demonstration purposes
def create_tool_schema():
    return {
        "name": "execute",
        "description": "Executes code on the user's machine",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "language": {

            },
            "required": ["language", "code"]
        }
    }

# Initialize the agent with the tools
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Accounting Agent",
    system_prompt="This agent assists with various accounting tasks.",
    sop_list=["Provide accurate and timely accounting services."],
    llm=llama3Hosted(),
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    verbose=True,
    tool_schema=BaseModel,
    list_base_models=[
        CalculateTax,
        GenerateInvoice,
        SummarizeExpenses
    ],
    output_type=str,
    metadata_output_type="json",
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",
    tools=[
        calculate_tax,
        generate_invoice,
        summarize_expenses
    ],
    list_base_models_json=create_tool_schema(),
)
```

### Running the Agent

The agent can execute tasks using the `run` method. This method takes a prompt and determines the appropriate tool to use based on the input.

**Example:**

```python
# Example task: Calculate tax for an income
result = agent.run("Calculate the tax for an income of $50,000.")
print(f"Result: {result}")

# Example task: Generate an invoice
invoice_data = agent.run("Generate an invoice for John Doe for $1500 on 2024-06-01.")
print(f"Invoice Data: {invoice_data}")

# Example task: Summarize expenses
expenses = [
    {"amount": 200.0, "description": "Office supplies"},
    {"amount": 1500.0, "description": "Software licenses"},
    {"amount": 300.0, "description": "Travel expenses"}
]
summary = agent.run("Summarize these expenses: " + str(expenses))
print(f"Expenses Summary: {summary}")
```


### Customizing Tools

Custom tools can be created to extend the functionality of the Swarms framework. This can include integrating external APIs, performing complex calculations, or handling specialized data formats.

**Example: Custom Accounting Tool**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CustomAccountingTool(BaseModel):
    data: dict

def custom_accounting_tool(data: CustomAccountingTool) -> dict:
    # Custom logic for the accounting tool
    result = {
        "status": "success",
        "data_processed": len(data.data)
    }
    return result

# Register the custom tool with the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Accounting Agent",
    system_prompt="This agent assists with various accounting tasks.",
    sop_list=["Provide accurate and timely accounting services."],
    llm=llama3Hosted(),
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    verbose=True,
    tool_schema=BaseModel,
    list_base_models=[
        CalculateTax,
        GenerateInvoice,
        SummarizeExpenses,
        CustomAccountingTool
    ],
    output_type=str,
    metadata_output_type="json",
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",
    tools=[
        calculate_tax,
        generate_invoice,
        summarize_expenses,
        custom_accounting_tool
    ],
    list_base_models_json=create_tool_schema(),
)
```

### Advanced Customization

Advanced customization involves modifying the core components of the Swarms framework. This includes extending existing classes, adding new methods, or integrating third-party libraries.

**Example: Extending the Agent Class**

```python
from swarms import Agent

class AdvancedAccountingAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def custom_behavior(self):
        print("Executing custom behavior")

    def another_custom_method(self):
        print("Another

 custom method")

# Initialize the advanced agent
advanced_agent = AdvancedAccountingAgent(
    agent_name="Advanced Accounting Agent",
    system_prompt="This agent performs advanced accounting tasks.",
    sop_list=["Provide advanced accounting services."],
    llm=llama3Hosted(),
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    verbose=True,
    tool_schema=BaseModel,
    list_base_models=[
        CalculateTax,
        GenerateInvoice,
        SummarizeExpenses,
        CustomAccountingTool
    ],
    output_type=str,
    metadata_output_type="json",
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",
    tools=[
        calculate_tax,
        generate_invoice,
        summarize_expenses,
        custom_accounting_tool
    ],
    list_base_models_json=create_tool_schema(),
)

# Call custom methods
advanced_agent.custom_behavior()
advanced_agent.another_custom_method()
```

### Integrating External Libraries

You can integrate external libraries to extend the functionality of your tools. This is useful for adding new capabilities or leveraging existing libraries for complex tasks.

**Example: Integrating Pandas for Data Processing**

```python
import pandas as pd
from pydantic import BaseModel

class DataFrameTool(BaseModel):
    data: list[dict]

def process_data_frame(data: DataFrameTool) -> dict:
    df = pd.DataFrame(data.data)
    summary = df.describe().to_dict()
    return {"summary": summary}

# Register the tool with the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Data Processing Agent",
    system_prompt="This agent processes data frames.",
    sop_list=["Provide data processing services."],
    llm=llama3Hosted(),
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    verbose=True,
    tool_schema=BaseModel,
    list_base_models=[DataFrameTool],
    output_type=str,
    metadata_output_type="json",
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",
    tools=[process_data_frame],
    list_base_models_json=create_tool_schema(),
)

# Example task: Process a data frame
data = [
    {"col1": 1, "col2": 2},
    {"col1": 3, "col2": 4},
    {"col1": 5, "col2": 6}
]
result = agent.run("Process this data frame: " + str(data))
print(f"Data Frame Summary: {result}")
```

## Conclusion

### Step 2: Configure Your Agent

Create an agent with the following key parameters:

```python
# Initialize the agent with cryptocurrency tools
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",                    # Unique identifier for your agent
    agent_description="Personal finance advisor agent with cryptocurrency market analysis capabilities",
    system_prompt="""You are a personal finance advisor agent with access to real-time 
    cryptocurrency data from CoinGecko. You can help users analyze market trends, check 
    coin prices, find trending cryptocurrencies, and search for specific coins. Always 
    provide accurate, up-to-date information and explain market data in an easy-to-understand way.""",
    max_loops=1,                                              # Number of reasoning loops
    max_tokens=4096,                                          # Maximum response length
    model_name="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",          # LLM model to use
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,                         # Enable adaptive creativity
    output_type="all",                                        # Return complete response
    tools=[                                                   # List of callable functions
        get_coin_price,
        get_top_cryptocurrencies,
        search_cryptocurrencies,
    ],
)
```

### Step 3: Use Your Agent

```python
# Example usage with different queries
response = agent.run("What are the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap?")
print(response)

# Query with specific parameters
response = agent.run("Get the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum in EUR")
print(response)

# Search functionality
response = agent.run("Search for cryptocurrencies related to 'cardano'")
print(response)
```

## Method 2: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

MCP servers provide a standardized way to create distributed tool functionality. They're ideal for:

- **Reusable tools** across multiple agents

- **Complex tool logic** that needs isolation

- **Third-party tool integration**

- **Scalable architectures**

### Step 1: Create Your MCP Server

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import requests

# Initialize the MCP server with configuration
mcp = FastMCP("OKXCryptoPrice")  # Server name for identification
mcp.settings.port = 8001         # Port for server communication
```

### Step 2: Define MCP Tools

Each MCP tool requires the `@mcp.tool` decorator with specific parameters:

```python
@mcp.tool(
    name="get_okx_crypto_price",                              # Tool identifier (must be unique)

    """
    Get the current price and basic information for a given cryptocurrency using OKX API.

                     If only base currency provided, '-USDT' will be appended
                     Case-insensitive input

    Returns:
        str: A formatted string containing:
             - Current price in USDT
             - 24-hour price change percentage
             - Formatted for human readability

    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: If the OKX API request fails
        ValueError: If symbol format is invalid
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to OKX servers

    Example:

        return f"Error fetching OKX data: {str(e)}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

### Step 3: Start Your MCP Server

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the MCP server with SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport
    # Server will be available at http://localhost:8001/sse
    mcp.run(transport="sse")
```

### Step 4: Connect Agent to MCP Server

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Method 2: Using direct URL (simpler for development)
mcp_url = "http://0.0.0.0:8001/sse"

# Initialize agent with MCP tools
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",                    # Agent identifier
    agent_description="Personal finance advisor with OKX exchange data access",
    system_prompt="""You are a financial analysis agent with access to real-time 
    cryptocurrency data from OKX exchange. You can check prices, analyze trading volumes, 
    and provide market insights. Always format numerical data clearly and explain 
    market movements in context.""",
    max_loops=1,                                              # Processing loops
    mcp_url=mcp_url,                                         # MCP server connection
    output_type="all",                                        # Complete response format
    # Note: tools are automatically loaded from MCP server
)
```

### Step 5: Use Your MCP-Enabled Agent

```python
# The agent automatically discovers and uses tools from the MCP server
response = agent.run(
    "Fetch the price for Bitcoin using the OKX exchange and also get its trading volume"
)
print(response)

# Multiple tool usage
response = agent.run(
    "Compare the prices of BTC, ETH, and ADA on OKX, and show their trading volumes"
)
print(response)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tool Not Found

```python
# Ensure function is in tools list
agent = Agent(
    # ... other config ...
    tools=[your_function_name],  # Function object, not string
)
```

#### MCP Connection Failed
```python
# Check server status and URL
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8001/health")  # Health check endpoint
```

#### Type Hint Errors

```python
# Always specify return types
def my_tool(param: str) -> str:  # Not just -> None
    return "result"
```

#### JSON Parsing Issues

```python
# Always return valid JSON strings
import json
return json.dumps({"result": data}, indent=2)
```

# Agent API

The Swarms.ai Agent API provides powerful endpoints for running individual AI agents and batch agent operations. This documentation explains how to use these endpoints for effective agent-based task execution.

## Getting Started

To use the Agent API, you'll need a Swarms.ai API key:

1. Go to [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys)
2. Generate a new API key
3. Store your API key securely - it won't be shown again

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API key from environment
load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "https://api.swarms.world"

# Configure headers with your API key
headers = {
    "x-api-key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

## Individual Agent API

The Individual Agent API allows you to run a single agent with a specific configuration and task.

### Agent Configuration (`AgentSpec`)

The `AgentSpec` class defines the configuration for an individual agent.

    },
    "timestamp": "2025-05-10T18:35:31.842Z"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Check your request parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| 403 | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Server Error - Something went wrong on the server |

When an error occurs, the response body will contain additional information:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message explaining what went wrong"
}
```

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Invalid API Key" | Verify your API key is correct and properly included in the request headers |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Reduce the number of requests or contact support to increase your rate limit |
| "Invalid agent configuration" | Check your agent_config parameters for any missing or invalid values |
| "Failed to create agent" | Ensure your system_prompt and model_name are valid |
| "Insufficient credits" | Add credits to your account at https://swarms.world/platform/account |

## Advanced Usage

### Setting Dynamic Temperature

The agent can dynamically adjust its temperature for optimal outputs:

```python
agent_config = {
    # Other config options...
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "dynamic_temperature_enabled": True
}
```

### Using Agent Tools

Agents can utilize various tools to enhance their capabilities:

```python
agent_config = {
    # Other config options...
    "tools_dictionary": [
        {
            "name": "web_search",
            "description": "Search the web for information",
            "parameters": {
                "query": "string"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "calculator",
            "description": "Perform mathematical calculations",
            "parameters": {
                "expression": "string"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

!!! tip "API Key Security"
    Store API keys in environment variables or secure vaults, never in code repositories.
    ```python
    # DON'T do this
    api_key = "sk-123456789abcdef"
    
    # DO this instead
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    api_key = os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY")
    ```

!!! info "Agent Naming Conventions"
    Use a consistent naming pattern for your agents to make your code more maintainable.
    ```python
    # Good naming convention
    agent_configs = {
        "market_analyst": {...},
        "research_specialist": {...},
        "code_reviewer": {...}
    }
    ```

!!! success "Crafting Effective System Prompts"
    A well-crafted system prompt acts as your agent's personality and instruction set.
    
    === "Basic Prompt"
        ```
        You are a research analyst. Analyze the data and provide insights.
        ```
    
    === "Enhanced Prompt"
        ```
        You are a Research Analyst with 15+ years of experience in biotech market analysis.
        
        Your task is to:
        1. Analyze the provided market data methodically
        2. Identify key trends and emerging patterns
        3. Highlight potential investment opportunities
        4. Assess risks and regulatory considerations
        5. Provide actionable recommendations supported by the data
        
        Format your response as a professional report with clear sections,
        focusing on data-driven insights rather than generalities.
        ```

!!! warning "Token Management"
    Manage your token usage carefully to control costs.
    
    - Higher token limits provide more complete responses but increase costs
    - Consider using different models based on task complexity
    - For gpt-4o models, typical settings:
        - Simple tasks: 2048 tokens (lower cost)
        - Medium complexity: 4096 tokens (balanced)
        - Complex analysis: 8192+ tokens (higher cost, more detail)

!!! danger "Error Handling"
    Implement comprehensive error handling to make your application resilient.
    
    ```python
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{BASE_URL}/v1/agent/completions",
            headers=headers,
            json=payload,
            timeout=30  # Add timeout to prevent hanging requests
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 429:
            # Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
            retry_after = int(e.response.headers.get('Retry-After', 5))
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            return run_agent(payload)  # Retry the request
        elif e.response.status_code == 401:
            logger.error("Authentication failed. Check your API key.")
        else:
            logger.error(f"HTTP Error: {e.response.status_code} - {e.response.text}")
        return {"error": e.response.text}
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        logger.error("Request timed out. The server might be busy.")
        return {"error": "Request timed out"}
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logger.error(f"Request Error: {e}")
        return {"error": str(e)}
    ```

!!! example "Implementing Caching"
    Cache identical requests to improve performance and reduce costs.
    
    ```python
    import hashlib
    import json
    from functools import lru_cache
    
    def generate_cache_key(agent_config, task):
        """Generate a unique cache key for an agent request."""
        cache_data = json.dumps({"agent_config": agent_config, "task": task}, sort_keys=True)
        return hashlib.md5(cache_data.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    @lru_cache(maxsize=100)

        """Wrapper function to run agent with caching."""
        # Generate a cache key
        cache_key = generate_cache_key(agent_config, task)
        
        # Convert agent_config to a hashable type for lru_cache
        hashable_config = json.dumps(agent_config, sort_keys=True)
        
        # Call the cached function
        return cached_agent_run(cache_key, hashable_config, task)
    ```

!!! abstract "Usage & Cost Monitoring"
    Set up a monitoring system to track your API usage and costs.
    
    ```python
    def log_api_usage(api_call_type, tokens_used, cost_estimate):
        """Log API usage for monitoring."""

## FAQ

??? question "What's the difference between Single Agent and Batch Agent APIs?"
    The Single Agent API (`/v1/agent/completions`) runs one agent with one task, while the Batch Agent API (`/v1/agent/batch/completions`) allows running multiple agents with different configurations and tasks in parallel. Use Batch Agent when you need to process multiple independent tasks efficiently.

??? question "How do I choose the right model for my agent?"
    Model selection depends on your task complexity, performance requirements, and budget:
    
    | Model | Best For | Characteristics |
    |-------|----------|-----------------|
    | gpt-4o | Complex analysis, creative tasks | Highest quality, most expensive |
    | gpt-4o-mini | General purpose tasks | Good balance of quality and cost |
    | openai/o3-mini | Simple, factual tasks | Fast, economical |
    
    For exploratory work, start with gpt-4o-mini and adjust based on results.

??? question "What should I include in my system prompt?"
    A good system prompt should include:
    
    1. **Role definition**: Who the agent is and their expertise
    2. **Task instructions**: Specific, clear directions on what to do
    3. **Output format**: How results should be structured
    4. **Constraints**: Any limitations or requirements
    5. **Examples**: Sample inputs and outputs when helpful
    
    Keep prompts focused and avoid contradictory instructions.

??? question "How can I optimize costs when using the Agent API?"
    Cost optimization strategies include:
    
    - Use the appropriate model for your task complexity
    - Set reasonable token limits based on expected output length
    - Implement caching for repeated or similar requests
    - Batch related requests together
    - Use `max_loops: 1` unless you specifically need iterative refinement
    - Monitor usage patterns and adjust configurations accordingly

??? question "What's the maximum number of agents I can run in a batch?"
    While there's no hard limit specified, we recommend keeping batch sizes under 20 agents for optimal performance. For very large batches, consider splitting them into multiple calls or contacting support for guidance on handling high-volume processing.

??? question "How do I handle rate limiting?"
    Implement exponential backoff in your error handling:
    
    ```python
    import time
    
    def run_with_backoff(func, max_retries=5, initial_delay=1):
        """Run a function with exponential backoff retry logic."""
        retries = 0
        delay = initial_delay
        
        while retries < max_retries:
            try:
                return func()
            except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
                if e.response.status_code == 429:  # Too Many Requests
                    retry_after = int(e.response.headers.get('Retry-After', delay))
                    print(f"Rate limited. Retrying after {retry_after} seconds...")
                    time.sleep(retry_after)
                    retries += 1
                    delay *= 2  # Exponential backoff
                else:
                    raise
            except Exception as e:
                raise
                
        raise Exception(f"Failed after {max_retries} retries")
    ```

??? question "Can I use tools with my agents?"
    Yes, you can enable tools through the `tools_dictionary` parameter in your agent configuration. This allows agents to access external functionality like web searches, calculations, or custom tools.
    
    ```python
    agent_config = {
        # Other configuration...
        "tools_dictionary": [
            {
                "name": "web_search",
                "description": "Search the web for current information",
                "parameters": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

??? question "How do I debug agent performance issues?"
    Debugging steps for agent performance issues:
    
    1. **Check system prompts**: Ensure they're clear and not overly restrictive
    2. **Review model selection**: Try a more capable model if output quality is poor
    3. **Adjust token limits**: Increase max_tokens if outputs are getting truncated
    4. **Examine temperature**: Lower for more deterministic outputs, higher for creativity
    5. **Test with simpler tasks**: Isolate whether the issue is with the task complexity
    6. **Enable verbose logging**: Add detailed logging to track request/response cycles
    7. **Contact support**: For persistent issues, reach out with example payloads and responses

??? question "What's the pricing model for the Agent API?"
    The Agent API uses a token-based pricing model:
    
    1. **Input tokens**: Text sent to the API (task, system prompts)
    2. **Output tokens**: Text generated by the agent
    
    Pricing varies by model and is calculated per 1,000 tokens. Check the [pricing page](https://swarms.world/platform/pricing) for current rates.
    
    The API also offers a "flex" tier for lower-priority, cost-effective processing.

# Under The Hood: The Swarm Cloud Serving Infrastructure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This blog post delves into the intricate workings of our serving model infrastructure, providing a comprehensive understanding for both users and infrastructure engineers. We'll embark on a journey that starts with an API request and culminates in a response generated by your chosen model, all orchestrated within a multi-cloud environment.

### The Journey of an API Request

1.  **The Gateway:** Your API request first arrives at an EC2 instance running SkyPilot, a lightweight controller.

2.  **Intelligent Routing:** SkyPilot, wielding its decision-making prowess, analyzes the request and identifies the most suitable GPU in our multi-cloud setup. Factors like resource availability, latency, and cost might influence this choice.

3.  **Multi-Cloud Agility:** Based on the chosen cloud provider (AWS or Azure), SkyPilot seamlessly directs the request to the appropriate containerized model residing in a sky clusters cluster. Here's where the magic of cloud-agnostic deployments comes into play.

### Unveiling the Architecture

Let's dissect the technical architecture behind this process:

-   **SkyPilot (EC2 Instance):** This lightweight controller, deployed on an EC2 instance, acts as the central hub for orchestrating requests and routing them to suitable model instances.

-   **Swarm Cloud Repositories:** Each model resides within its own dedicated folder on the Swarms Cloud GitHub repository (<https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms-cloud>). Here, you'll find a folder structure like this:

```
servers/
  <model_name_1>/
    sky-serve.yaml  # Deployment configuration file
  <model_name_2>/
    sky-serve.yaml
  ...

```

-   **SkyServe Deployment Tool:** This is the workhorse responsible for deploying models within sky clusters. Each model's folder contains a `sky-serve.yaml` file that dictates the deployment configuration.

### Infrastructure Engineer's Toolkit: Commands for Model Deployment

Here's a breakdown of the `sky serve` command and its subcommands:

-   `sky serve -h`: Displays the help message for the `sky serve` CLI tool.

**Commands:**

-   `sky serve up yaml.yaml -n --cloud aws/azure`: This command deploys a SkyServe service based on the provided `yaml.yaml` configuration file. The `-n` flag indicates a new deployment, and the `--cloud` flag specifies the target cloud platform (AWS or Azure).

**Additional Commands:**

-   `sky serve update`: Updates a running SkyServe service.

-   `sky serve status`: Shows the status of deployed SkyServe services.

-   `sky serve down`: Tears down (stops and removes) a SkyServe service.

-   `sky serve logs`: Tails the logs of a running SkyServe service, providing valuable insights into its operation.

By leveraging these commands, infrastructure engineers can efficiently manage the deployment and lifecycle of models within the multi-cloud environment.

**Building the Cluster and Accessing the Model:**

When you deploy a model using `sky serve up`, SkyServe triggers the building of a sky clusters cluster, if one doesn't already exist. Once the deployment is complete, SkyServe provides you with an endpoint URL for interacting with the model. This URL allows you to send requests to the deployed model and receive its predictions.

### Understanding the `sky-serve.yaml` Configuration

The `sky-serve.yaml` file plays a crucial role in defining the deployment parameters for your model. This file typically includes properties such as:

-   **Image:** Specifies the Docker image containing your model code and dependencies.

-   **Replicas:** Defines the number of model replicas to be deployed in the Swarm cluster. This allows for load balancing and fault tolerance.

-   **Resources:** Sets memory and CPU resource constraints for the deployed model containers.

-   **Networking:** Configures network settings for communication within the sky clusters and with the outside world.

**Benefits of Our Infrastructure:**

-   **Multi-Cloud Flexibility:** Deploy models seamlessly across AWS and Azure, taking advantage of whichever platform best suits your needs.

-   **Scalability:** Easily scale model deployments up or down based on traffic demands.

-   **Cost Optimization:** The intelligent routing by SkyPilot helps optimize costs by utilizing the most cost-effective cloud resources.

-   **Simplified Management:** Manage models across clouds with a single set of commands using `sky serve`.

### Deep Dive: Technical Architecture

**Cloud Considerations:**

Our multi-cloud architecture offers several advantages, but it also introduces complexities that need to be addressed. Here's a closer look at some key considerations:

-   **Cloud Provider APIs and SDKs:** SkyPilot interacts with the APIs and SDKs of the chosen cloud provider (AWS or Azure) to manage resources like virtual machines, storage, and networking. Infrastructure engineers need to be familiar with the specific APIs and SDKs for each cloud platform to ensure smooth operation and troubleshooting.

-   **Security:** Maintaining consistent security across different cloud environments is crucial. This involves aspects like IAM (Identity and Access Management) configuration, network segmentation, and encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit. Infrastructure engineers need to implement robust security measures tailored to each cloud provider's offerings.

-   **Network Connectivity:** Establishing secure and reliable network connectivity between SkyPilot (running on EC2), sky clusters clusters (deployed on cloud VMs), and your client applications is essential. This might involve setting up VPN tunnels or utilizing cloud-native networking solutions offered by each provider.

-   **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitoring the health and performance of SkyPilot, sky clusters clusters, and deployed models across clouds is critical for proactive issue identification and resolution. Infrastructure engineers can leverage cloud provider-specific monitoring tools alongside centralized logging solutions for comprehensive oversight.

**sky clusters Clusters**

sky clusters is a container orchestration platform that facilitates the deployment and management of containerized applications, including your machine learning models. When you deploy a model with `sky serve up`, SkyPilot launches an node with:

-   **Provision Resources:** SkyPilot requests resources from the chosen cloud provider (e.g., VMs with GPUs) to create a sky clusters cluster if one doesn't already exist.

-   **Deploy Containerized Models:** SkyPilot leverages the `sky-serve.yaml` configuration to build Docker images containing your model code and dependencies. These images are then pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub) and deployed as containers within the Swarm cluster.

-   **Load Balancing and Service Discovery:** sky clusters provides built-in load balancing capabilities to distribute incoming requests across multiple model replicas, ensuring high availability and performance. Additionally, service discovery mechanisms allow models to find each other and communicate within the cluster.

**SkyPilot - The Orchestrator**

SkyPilot, the lightweight controller running on an EC2 instance, plays a central role in this infrastructure. Here's a deeper look at its functionalities:

-   **API Gateway Integration:** SkyPilot can be integrated with your API gateway or service mesh to receive incoming requests for model predictions.

-   **Request Routing:** SkyPilot analyzes the incoming request, considering factors like model compatibility, resource availability, and latency. Based on this analysis, SkyPilot selects the most suitable model instance within the appropriate sky clusters cluster.

-   **Cloud Provider Interaction:** SkyPilot interacts with the chosen cloud provider's APIs to manage resources required for the sky clusters cluster and model deployment.

-   **Model Health Monitoring:** SkyPilot can be configured to monitor the health and performance of deployed models. This might involve collecting metrics like model response times, resource utilization, and error rates.

-   **Scalability Management:** Based on pre-defined policies or real-time traffic patterns, SkyPilot can trigger the scaling of model deployments (adding or removing replicas) within the sky clusters cluster.

**Advanced Considerations**

This blog post has provided a foundational understanding of our serving model infrastructure. For infrastructure engineers seeking a deeper dive, here are some additional considerations:

-   **Container Security:** Explore container image scanning for vulnerabilities, enforcing least privilege principles within container runtime environments, and utilizing secrets management solutions for secure access to sensitive data.

-   **Model Versioning and Rollbacks:** Implement a model versioning strategy to track changes and facilitate rollbacks to previous versions if necessary.

-   **A/B Testing:** Integrate A/B testing frameworks to evaluate the performance of different model versions and configurations before full-scale deployment.

-   **Auto-Scaling with Cloud Monitoring:** Utilize cloud provider-specific monitoring services like Amazon CloudWatch or Azure Monitor to trigger auto-scaling of sky clusters clusters based on predefined metrics.

By understanding these technical aspects and considerations, infrastructure engineers can effectively manage and optimize our multi-cloud serving model infrastructure.

### Conclusion

This comprehensive exploration has shed light on the intricate workings of our serving model infrastructure. We've covered the journey of an API request, delved into the technical architecture with a focus on cloud considerations, sky clusters clusters, and SkyPilot's role as the orchestrator. We've also explored advanced considerations for infrastructure engineers seeking to further optimize and secure this multi-cloud environment.

This understanding empowers both users and infrastructure engineers to leverage this technology effectively for deploying and managing your machine learning models at scale.

   - Visit the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and enable the following APIs:
     - Cloud Run API
     - Cloud Build API
     - Artifact Registry API
   - These APIs are essential for deploying and managing your application in Cloud Run.

---

## **Step 2: Creating the Files**

### 1. **`api/api.py`**

This is the main Python script where you define your Swarms agents and expose an API endpoint for interacting with them. Here’s an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from swarms import Agent  # Assuming `swarms` is the framework you're using

app = Flask(__name__)

# Example Swarm agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Stock-Analysis-Agent",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    streaming_on=True,
)

@app.route('/run-agent', methods=['POST'])
def run_agent():
    data = request.json
    task = data.get('task', '')
    result = agent.run(task)
    return jsonify({"result": result})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

This example sets up a basic API that listens for POST requests, processes a task using a Swarm agent, and returns the result as a JSON response. Customize it based on your agent’s functionality.

---

### 2. **`requirements.txt`**

This file lists all Python dependencies required for your project. Example:

```
flask
swarms
# add any other dependencies here
```

Be sure to include any additional libraries your agents rely on. Keeping this file up to date ensures smooth dependency management during deployment.

---

### 3. **`Dockerfile`**

The Dockerfile specifies how your application is containerized. Below is a sample Dockerfile for your setup:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY api/ ./api/

# Expose port 8080 (Cloud Run default port)
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "api/api.py"]
```

This Dockerfile ensures your application is containerized with minimal overhead, focusing on slim images for efficiency.

---

## **Step 3: Deploying to Google Cloud Run**

### 1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**

Log in to your Google Cloud account by running:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

Set the active project to match your deployment target:

```bash
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual Project ID.

---

### 2. **Build the Docker Image**

Use Google Cloud's Artifact Registry to store and manage your Docker image. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Repository**:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create my-repo --repository-format=Docker --location=us-central1
```

2. **Authenticate Docker with Google Cloud**:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

3. **Build and Tag the Image**:

```bash
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image .
```

4. **Push the Image**:

```bash
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image
```

---

### 3. **Deploy to Cloud Run**

Deploy the application to Cloud Run with the following command:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent-service \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

Key points:
- Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual Project ID.
- The `--allow-unauthenticated` flag makes the service publicly accessible. Exclude it to restrict access.

---

## **Step 4: Testing the Deployment**

Once the deployment is complete, test the service:

1. Note the URL provided by Cloud Run.
2. Use `curl` or Postman to send a request. Example:

```bash
curl -X POST [CLOUD_RUN_URL]/run-agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "example task"}'
```

This tests whether your agent processes the task correctly and returns the expected output.

---

## **Step 5: Updating the Service**

To apply changes to your application:

1. Edit the necessary files.
2. Rebuild and push the updated Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image
```

3. Redeploy the service:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent-service \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT_ID]/my-repo/my-image
```

This ensures the latest version of your application is live.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Permission Errors**:
  Ensure your account has roles like Cloud Run Admin and Artifact Registry Reader.
- **Port Issues**:
  Confirm the application listens on port 8080. Cloud Run expects this port by default.
- **Logs**:
  Use the Google Cloud Console or CLI to review logs for debugging:

```bash
gcloud logs read --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

---

## **Conclusion**

By following this comprehensive guide, you can deploy your agents on Google Cloud Run with ease. This method leverages Docker for containerization and Google Cloud services for seamless scalability and management. With a robust setup like this, you can focus on enhancing your agents’ capabilities rather than worrying about deployment challenges.

## Error Handling
The client uses exception handling to manage various error scenarios:

```python
from swarms_cloud import SwarmCloudAPI
import httpx

try:
    client = SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here")
    agents = client.list_agents()
except httpx.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
except Exception as err:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {err}")
finally:
    client.close()
```

## Context Manager Support
The client can be used with Python's context manager:

```python
with SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here") as client:
    status = client.health()
    print(f"API Status: {status}")
    # Client automatically closes after the with block
```

## Best Practices

1. Always close the client when finished:
```python
client = SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here")
try:
    # Your code here
finally:
    client.close()
```

2. Use context managers for automatic cleanup:
```python
with SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here") as client:
    # Your code here
```

3. Handle errors appropriately:
```python
try:
    result = client.execute_agent("agent_id", payload={"data": "test"})
except httpx.HTTPError as e:
    logger.error(f"HTTP error: {e}")
    # Handle error appropriately
```

4. Set appropriate timeouts for your use case:
```python
client = SwarmCloudAPI(
    api_key="your_api_key_here",
    timeout=30.0  # Longer timeout for complex operations
)
```

## Complete Example
Here's a complete example showcasing various features of the client:

```python
from swarms_cloud import SwarmCloudAPI, AgentCreate, AgentUpdate
import httpx

def main():
    with SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here") as client:
        # Create an agent
        agent_data = AgentCreate(
            name="DataAnalyzer",
            description="Analyzes incoming data streams",
            code="""
            def main(request, store):
                data = request.payload.get('data', [])
                return {
                    'count': len(data),
                    'summary': 'Data processed successfully'
                }
            """,
            requirements="pandas==1.4.0",
            autoscaling=True
        )
        
        try:
            # Create the agent
            new_agent = client.create_agent(agent_data)
            print(f"Created agent: {new_agent.name} (ID: {new_agent.id})")
            
            # Execute the agent
            result = client.execute_agent(
                new_agent.id,
                payload={"data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
            )
            print(f"Execution result: {result}")
            
            # Update the agent
            update_data = AgentUpdate(
                description="Enhanced data analysis capabilities"
            )
            updated_agent = client.update_agent(new_agent.id, update_data)
            print(f"Updated agent: {updated_agent.name}")
            
            # Get execution history
            history = client.get_agent_history(new_agent.id)
            print(f"Execution history: {history}")
            
        except httpx.HTTPError as e:
            print(f"HTTP error occurred: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Logging
The client uses the `loguru` library for logging. You can configure the logging level and format:

```python
from loguru import logger

# Configure logging
logger.add("swarmcloud.log", rotation="500 MB")

client = SwarmCloudAPI(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Reuse**: The client reuses HTTP connections by default, improving performance for multiple requests.

2. **Timeout Configuration**: Set appropriate timeouts based on your use case:
```python
client = SwarmCloudAPI(
    api_key="your_api_key_here",
    timeout=5.0  # Shorter timeout for time-sensitive operations
)
```

3. **Batch Operations**: Use batch_execute_agents for multiple agent executions:
```python
results = client.batch_execute_agents(
    agents=agents,
    payload=shared_payload
)
```

## Rate Limiting
The client respects API rate limits but does not implement retry logic. Implement your own retry mechanism if needed:

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def execute_with_retry(client, agent_id, payload):
    return client.execute_agent(agent_id, payload)
```

## Thread Safety
The client is not thread-safe by default. For concurrent usage, create separate client instances for each thread or implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error messages in JSON format.

**Common Status Codes:**

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid input |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| 422 | Validation Error - Request validation failed |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

**Error Response Format:**

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["body", "patient_id"],
      "msg": "field required",
      "type": "value_error.missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

    patient_id: str,
    case_description: str
) -> QueryResponse:
```

**Arguments:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|

print(response.case_data)
```

### run_batch

Process multiple patient cases in batch.

```python
def run_batch(
    self,
    cases: List[PatientCase]
) -> List[QueryResponse]:
```

**Arguments:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| cases | List[PatientCase] | Yes | List of patient cases |

**Example:**
```python
cases = [
    PatientCase("P124", "Case 1 description..."),
    PatientCase("P125", "Case 2 description...")
]
responses = client.run_batch(cases)
for response in responses:
    print(f"Patient {response.patient_id}: {response.case_data}")
```

### get_patient_data

Retrieve data for a specific patient.

```python
def get_patient_data(
    self,
    patient_id: str
) -> QueryResponse:
```

**Example:**
```python
patient_data = client.get_patient_data("P123")
print(f"Patient data: {patient_data.case_data}")
```

### get_all_patients

Retrieve data for all patients.

```python
def get_all_patients(self) -> List[QueryResponse]:
```

**Example:**
```python
all_patients = client.get_all_patients()
for patient in all_patients:
    print(f"Patient {patient.patient_id}: {patient.case_data}")
```

### get_rate_limits

Get current rate limit status.

```python
def get_rate_limits(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

**Example:**
```python
rate_limits = client.get_rate_limits()
print(f"Rate limit status: {rate_limits}")
```

### health_check

Check if the API is operational.

```python
def health_check(self) -> bool:
```

**Example:**
```python
is_healthy = client.health_check()
print(f"API health: {'Healthy' if is_healthy else 'Unhealthy'}")
```

## Error Handling

### Exception Hierarchy

| Exception | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| MCSClientError | Base exception for all client errors |
| RateLimitError | Raised when API rate limit is exceeded |
| AuthenticationError | Raised when API authentication fails |
| ValidationError | Raised when request validation fails |

### Example Error Handling

```python
from mcs import MCSClient, MCSClientError, RateLimitError

with MCSClient() as client:
    try:
        response = client.run_medical_coder("P123", "Case description...")
    except RateLimitError:
        print("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before retrying.")
    except MCSClientError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Retry Configuration

The client implements two levels of retry logic:

1. Connection-level retries (using `HTTPAdapter`):
```python
client = MCSClient(
    ,
    max_retries=5  # Adjusts connection-level retries
)
```

2. Application-level retries (using `tenacity`):
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
def process_with_custom_retries():
    with MCSClient() as client:
        return client.run_medical_coder("P123", "Case description...")
```

### Batch Processing with Progress Tracking

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

with MCSClient() as client:
    cases = [
        PatientCase(f"P{i}", f"Case description {i}")
        for i in range(100)
    ]
    
    # Process in smaller batches
    batch_size = 10
    results = []
    
    for i in tqdm(range(0, len(cases), batch_size)):
        batch = cases[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_results = client.run_batch(batch)
        results.extend(batch_results)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use context managers:**
   ```python
   with MCSClient() as client:
       # Your code here
       pass
   ```

2. **Handle rate limits appropriately:**
   ```python
   from time import sleep
   
   def process_with_rate_limit_handling():
       with MCSClient() as client:
           try:
               return client.run_medical_coder("P123", "Case...")
           except RateLimitError:
               sleep(60)  # Wait before retry
               return client.run_medical_coder("P123", "Case...")
   ```

3. **Implement proper logging:**
   ```python

-------

As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and enable a wide range of powerful applications, enterprises are increasingly exploring multi-agent architectures to leverage the collective capabilities of multiple LLMs. However, coordinating and optimizing the performance of these complex multi-agent systems presents significant challenges.

This comprehensive guide provides enterprise architects, engineering leaders, and technical decision-makers with a strategic framework for maximizing performance across multi-agent LLM deployments. Developed through extensive research and collaboration with industry partners, this guide distills best practices, proven techniques, and cutting-edge methodologies into seven core principles.

By implementing the recommendations outlined in this guide, organizations can achieve superior latency, throughput, and resource utilization while ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and optimal user experiences. Whether powering customer-facing conversational agents, driving internal knowledge management systems, or fueling mission-critical decision support tools, high-performance multi-agent LLM deployments will be pivotal to unlocking the full potential of this transformative technology.

## Introduction

The rise of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era of human-machine interaction, enabling enterprises to develop sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) applications that can understand, generate, and reason with human-like text. However, as the complexity and scale of LLM deployments grow, traditional monolithic architectures are increasingly challenged to meet the stringent performance, scalability, and cost requirements of enterprise environments.

Multi-agent architectures, which coordinate the collective capabilities of multiple specialized LLMs, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for addressing these challenges. By distributing workloads across a cohort of agents, each optimized for specific tasks or domains, multi-agent systems can deliver superior performance, resilience, and adaptability compared to single-model solutions.

However, realizing the full potential of multi-agent LLM deployments requires a strategic approach to system design, optimization, and ongoing management. This guide presents a comprehensive framework for maximizing performance across seven core principles, each underpinned by a range of proven techniques and methodologies.

Whether you are architecting a customer-facing conversational agent, building an internal knowledge management platform, or developing a mission-critical decision support system, this guide will equip you with the insights and best practices necessary to unlock the full potential of multi-agent LLM deployments within your enterprise.

## Principle 1: Distribute Token Processing
----------------------------------------

At the heart of every LLM deployment lies the fundamental challenge of optimizing token processing -- the rate at which the model consumes and generates text inputs and outputs. In multi-agent architectures, distributing and parallelizing token processing across multiple agents is a critical performance optimization strategy.

### Agent Specialization

One of the key advantages of multi-agent architectures is the ability to dedicate specific agents to specialized tasks or domains. By carefully matching agents to the workloads they are optimized for, enterprises can maximize overall throughput and minimize latency.

For example, in a conversational agent deployment, one agent may be optimized for intent recognition and query understanding, while another is fine-tuned for generating coherent, context-aware responses. In a document processing pipeline, separate agents could be dedicated to tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and summarization.

To effectively leverage agent specialization, enterprises should:

-   Conduct a thorough analysis of their application's workflow and identify distinct tasks or domains that could benefit from dedicated agents.
-   Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of available LLM models and agents, and map them to the identified tasks or domains based on their capabilities and performance characteristics.
-   Implement continuous monitoring and performance tuning processes to ensure agents remain optimized for their assigned workloads as models evolve and domain requirements shift.

### Load Balancing

Even with a well-designed allocation of tasks across specialized agents, fluctuations in workload and demand can create bottlenecks and performance degradation. Effective load balancing strategies are essential to ensure that token processing capacity is dynamically distributed across available agents based on real-time conditions.

Load balancing in multi-agent LLM deployments can be accomplished through a combination of techniques, including:

-   **Round-Robin**: Distributing incoming requests across agents in a cyclical fashion, ensuring an even distribution of workload.
-   **Least Connections**: Routing requests to the agent with the fewest active connections or outstanding tasks, minimizing the risk of overloading any single agent.
-   **Response Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the response times of each agent and dynamically adjusting request routing to favor faster-responding agents.
-   **Resource-Based Routing**: Factoring in agent-level resource consumption (e.g., CPU, memory) when making routing decisions, ensuring that overloaded agents are relieved of additional workload.

Implementing effective load balancing requires careful consideration of the specific characteristics and requirements of your multi-agent deployment, as well as the integration of robust monitoring and analytics capabilities to inform dynamic routing decisions.

### Horizontal Scaling

While load balancing optimizes the utilization of existing agent resources, horizontal scaling strategies enable organizations to dynamically provision additional token processing capacity to meet demand spikes or handle larger overall workloads.

In multi-agent LLM deployments, horizontal scaling can be achieved through:

-   **Agent Replication**: Spin up additional instances of existing agents to increase parallel processing capacity for specific tasks or domains.
-   **Hybrid Scaling**: Combine agent replication with the dynamic provisioning of additional compute resources (e.g., CPU, GPU) to support the increased agent count.
-   **Serverless Deployment**: Leverage serverless computing platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to automatically scale agent instances based on real-time demand, minimizing idle resource consumption.

Effective horizontal scaling requires robust orchestration and management capabilities, as well as seamless integration with load balancing mechanisms to ensure that incoming workloads are efficiently distributed across the dynamically scaled agent pool.

## Principle 2: Optimize Agent Communication
-----------------------------------------

In multi-agent LLM deployments, efficient inter-agent communication is crucial for coordinating tasks, exchanging context and intermediate results, and maintaining overall system coherence. However, communication overhead can quickly become a performance bottleneck if not carefully managed.

### Minimizing Overhead

Reducing the volume and complexity of information exchanged between agents is a key strategy for optimizing communication performance. Techniques for minimizing overhead include:

-   **Data Compression**: Applying lossless or lossy compression algorithms to reduce the size of data payloads exchanged between agents, lowering bandwidth requirements and transmission latencies.
-   **Information Summarization**: Distilling and summarizing context, results, or other data exchanged between agents to its essential elements, minimizing redundant or non-critical information.
-   **Differential Updates**: Rather than transmitting entire data payloads, agents can exchange only the differential updates or deltas required to synchronize their respective states.

Implementing these techniques requires careful analysis of the specific data exchange patterns and communication requirements within your multi-agent deployment, as well as the integration of appropriate compression, summarization, and differential update algorithms.

### Prioritizing Critical Information

In scenarios where communication bandwidth or latency constraints cannot be fully alleviated through overhead reduction techniques, enterprises can prioritize the exchange of critical information over non-essential data.

This can be achieved through:

-   **Prioritized Queuing**: Implementing queuing mechanisms that prioritize the transmission of high-priority, time-sensitive data over lower-priority, non-critical information.
-   **Selective Communication**: Dynamically determining which agents require specific pieces of information based on their roles and responsibilities, and selectively transmitting data only to those agents that truly need it.
-   **Progressive Information Exchange**: Exchanging information in a progressive or staged manner, with critical elements transmitted first, followed by supplementary or contextual data as bandwidth becomes available.

Effective prioritization requires a deep understanding of the interdependencies and information flow within your multi-agent system, as well as the ability to dynamically assess and prioritize data based on its criticality and urgency.

### Caching and Reusing Context

In many multi-agent LLM deployments, agents frequently exchange or operate on shared context, such as user profiles, conversation histories, or domain-specific knowledge bases. Caching and reusing this context information can significantly reduce redundant communication and processing overhead.

Strategies for optimizing context caching and reuse include:

-   **Agent-Level Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms within individual agents to store and retrieve frequently accessed context data, minimizing the need for inter-agent communication.
-   **Centralized Context Management**: Deploying a dedicated context management service or data store that agents can query and update, ensuring consistent access to the latest context information across the system.
-   **Context Versioning and Invalidation**: Implementing versioning and invalidation mechanisms to ensure that cached context data remains fresh and consistent, avoiding stale or outdated information from propagating through the system.


### Principle 3: Leverage Agent Specialization
------------------------------------------

One of the key advantages of multi-agent architectures is the ability to optimize individual agents for specific tasks, domains, or capabilities. By leveraging agent specialization, enterprises can ensure that each component of their LLM system is finely tuned for maximum performance and quality.

### Task-Specific Optimization

Within a multi-agent LLM deployment, different agents may be responsible for distinct tasks such as language understanding, knowledge retrieval, response generation, or post-processing. Optimizing each agent for its designated task can yield significant performance gains and quality improvements.

Techniques for task-specific optimization include:

-   **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting carefully designed prompts that provide the necessary context, instructions, and examples to guide an agent towards optimal performance for its assigned task.
-   **Fine-Tuning**: Adapting a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain by fine-tuning it on a curated dataset, allowing the agent to specialize and improve its performance on that particular workload.
-   **Model Distillation**: Transferring the knowledge and capabilities of a larger, more capable LLM into a smaller, more efficient model specialized for a specific task, balancing performance and quality trade-offs.

Implementing these optimization techniques requires a deep understanding of the capabilities and requirements of each task within your multi-agent system, as well as access to relevant training data and computational resources for fine-tuning and distillation processes.

### Domain Adaptation

Many enterprise applications operate within specific domains or verticals, such as finance, healthcare, or legal. Adapting agents to these specialized domains can significantly improve their performance, accuracy, and compliance within the target domain.

Strategies for domain adaptation include:

-   **Domain-Specific Pre-Training**: Leveraging domain-specific corpora to pre-train LLM agents, imbuing them with a foundational understanding of the language, concepts, and nuances specific to the target domain.
-   **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning agents that have been pre-trained on general or adjacent domains, transferring their existing knowledge and capabilities to the target domain while optimizing for its specific characteristics.
-   **Domain Persona Injection**: Injecting domain-specific personas, traits, or constraints into agents during fine-tuning or deployment, shaping their behavior and outputs to align with domain-specific norms and requirements.

Effective domain adaptation requires access to high-quality, domain-specific training data, as well as close collaboration with subject matter experts to ensure that agents are properly calibrated to meet the unique demands of the target domain.

### Ensemble Techniques

In complex multi-agent deployments, individual agents may excel at specific subtasks or aspects of the overall workflow. Ensemble techniques that combine the outputs or predictions of multiple specialized agents can often outperform any single agent, leveraging the collective strengths of the ensemble.

Common ensemble techniques for multi-agent LLM systems include:

-   **Voting**: Combining the outputs or predictions of multiple agents through majority voting, weighted voting, or other consensus mechanisms.
-   **Stacking**: Training a meta-agent to combine and optimize the outputs of multiple base agents, effectively learning to leverage their collective strengths.
-   **Blending**: Combining the outputs of multiple agents through weighted averaging, linear interpolation, or other blending techniques, allowing for nuanced integration of diverse perspectives.

Implementing effective ensemble techniques requires careful analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and complementary capabilities of individual agents, as well as the development of robust combination strategies that can optimally leverage the ensemble's collective intelligence.

### Principle 4: Implement Dynamic Scaling
--------------------------------------

The demand and workload patterns of enterprise LLM deployments can be highly dynamic, with significant fluctuations driven by factors such as user activity, data ingestion schedules, or periodic batch processing. Implementing dynamic scaling strategies allows organizations to optimally provision and allocate resources in response to these fluctuations, ensuring consistent performance while minimizing unnecessary costs.

### Autoscaling

Autoscaling is a core capability that enables the automatic adjustment of compute resources (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory) and agent instances based on real-time demand patterns and workload metrics. By dynamically scaling resources up or down, enterprises can maintain optimal performance and resource utilization, avoiding both over-provisioning and under-provisioning scenarios.

Effective autoscaling in multi-agent LLM deployments requires:

-   **Monitoring and Metrics**: Implementing robust monitoring and metrics collection mechanisms to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as request rates, response times, resource utilization, and agent-level metrics.
-   **Scaling Policies**: Defining scaling policies that specify the conditions and thresholds for triggering automatic scaling actions, such as provisioning additional agents or compute resources when certain KPIs are breached.
-   **Scaling Orchestration**: Integrating autoscaling capabilities with resource orchestration and management tools (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling) to seamlessly provision, configure, and integrate new resources into the existing multi-agent deployment.

By automating the scaling process, enterprises can respond rapidly to workload fluctuations, ensuring consistent performance and optimal resource utilization without the need for manual intervention.

### Spot Instance Utilization

Many cloud providers offer spot instances or preemptible resources at significantly discounted prices compared to on-demand or reserved instances. While these resources may be reclaimed with little notice, they can be leveraged judiciously within multi-agent LLM deployments to reduce operational costs.

Strategies for leveraging spot instances include:

-   **Fault-Tolerant Agent Deployment**: Deploying certain agents or components of the multi-agent system on spot instances, while ensuring that these components can be rapidly and seamlessly replaced or migrated in the event of instance preemption.
-   **Batch Workload Offloading**: Offloading batch processing workloads or non-time-sensitive tasks to spot instances, leveraging their cost-effectiveness while minimizing the impact of potential disruptions.
-   **Hybrid Provisioning**: Implementing a hybrid approach that combines on-demand or reserved instances for mission-critical components with spot instances for more flexible or elastic workloads.

Effective spot instance utilization requires careful architectural considerations to ensure fault tolerance and minimize the impact of potential disruptions, as well as robust monitoring and automation capabilities to seamlessly replace or migrate workloads in response to instance preemption events.

### Serverless Deployments

Serverless computing platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions, offer a compelling alternative to traditional server-based deployments. By automatically scaling compute resources based on real-time demand and charging only for the resources consumed, serverless architectures can provide significant cost savings and operational simplicity.

Leveraging serverless deployments for multi-agent LLM systems can be achieved through:

-   **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) Agents**: Deploying individual agents or components of the multi-agent system as serverless functions, allowing for rapid and automatic scaling in response to fluctuating workloads.
-   **Event-Driven Architectures**: Designing the multi-agent system to operate in an event-driven manner, with agents triggered and executed in response to specific events or data ingestion, aligning with the serverless execution model.
-   **Hybrid Deployments**: Combining serverless components with traditional server-based components, leveraging the strengths and cost advantages of each deployment model for different aspects of the multi-agent system.

Adopting serverless architectures requires careful consideration of factors such as execution duration limits, cold start latencies, and integration with other components of the multi-agent deployment. However, when implemented effectively, serverless deployments can provide unparalleled scalability, cost-efficiency, and operational simplicity for dynamic, event-driven workloads.


### Principle 5: Employ Selective Execution
---------------------------------------

Not every input or request within a multi-agent LLM deployment requires the full execution of all agents or the complete processing pipeline. Selectively invoking agents or tasks based on input characteristics or intermediate results can significantly optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and resource consumption.

### Input Filtering

Implementing input filtering mechanisms allows enterprises to reject or bypass certain inputs before they are processed by the multi-agent system. This can be achieved through techniques such as:

-   **Blacklisting/Whitelisting**: Maintaining lists of inputs (e.g., specific phrases, URLs, or content types) that should be automatically rejected or allowed, based on predefined criteria.
-   **Rules-Based Filtering**: Defining a set of rules or heuristics to assess the suitability or relevance of an input for further processing, based on factors such as language, content, or metadata.
-   **Confidence Thresholding**: Leveraging pre-processing agents or models to assess the likelihood that an input is relevant or valuable, and filtering out inputs that fall below a predetermined confidence threshold.

Effective input filtering requires careful consideration of the specific requirements, constraints, and objectives of your multi-agent deployment, as well as ongoing monitoring and adjustment of filtering rules and thresholds to maintain optimal performance and accuracy.

### Early Stopping

In many multi-agent LLM deployments, intermediate results or predictions generated by early-stage agents can be used to determine whether further processing is required or valuable. Early stopping mechanisms allow enterprises to terminate execution pipelines when specific conditions or thresholds are met, avoiding unnecessary downstream processing.

Techniques for implementing early stopping include:

-   **Confidence-Based Stopping**: Monitoring the confidence scores or probabilities associated with intermediate results, and terminating execution if a predefined confidence threshold is exceeded.
-   **Exception-Based Stopping**: Defining specific intermediate results or conditions that indicate that further processing is unnecessary or undesirable, and terminating execution upon encountering these exceptions.
-   **Adaptive Stopping**: Employing machine learning models or reinforcement learning agents to dynamically determine when to terminate execution based on learned patterns and trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and resource consumption.

Effective early stopping requires a deep understanding of the interdependencies and decision points within your multi-agent workflow, as well as careful tuning and monitoring to ensure that stopping conditions are calibrated to maintain an optimal balance between performance and accuracy.

### Conditional Branching

Rather than executing a linear, fixed pipeline of agents, conditional branching allows multi-agent systems to dynamically invoke different agents or execution paths based on input characteristics or intermediate results. This can significantly optimize resource utilization by ensuring that only the necessary agents and processes are executed for a given input or scenario.

Implementing conditional branching involves:

-   **Decision Points**: Identifying key points within the multi-agent workflow where branching decisions can be made based on input or intermediate data.
-   **Branching Logic**: Defining the rules, conditions, or machine learning models that will evaluate the input or intermediate data and determine the appropriate execution path or agent invocation.
-   **Execution Routing**: Integrating mechanisms to dynamically route inputs or intermediate data to the appropriate agents or processes based on the branching decision.

Conditional branching can be particularly effective in scenarios where inputs or workloads exhibit distinct characteristics or require significantly different processing pipelines, allowing enterprises to optimize resource allocation and minimize unnecessary computation.

### Principle 6: Optimize User Experience
-------------------------------------

While many of the principles outlined in this guide focus on optimizing backend performance and resource utilization, delivering an exceptional user experience is also a critical consideration for enterprise multi-agent LLM deployments. By minimizing perceived wait times and providing real-time progress updates, organizations can ensure that users remain engaged and satisfied, even during periods of high workload or resource constraints.

### Streaming Responses

One of the most effective techniques for minimizing perceived wait times is to stream responses or outputs to users as they are generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be completed before delivering it. This approach is particularly valuable in conversational agents, document summarization, or other scenarios where outputs can be naturally segmented and delivered incrementally.

Implementing streaming responses requires:

-   **Partial Output Generation**: Modifying agents or models to generate and emit outputs in a streaming or incremental fashion, rather than producing the entire output in a single, monolithic operation.
-   **Streaming Data Pipelines**: Integrating streaming data pipelines and message queues to enable the efficient and reliable transmission of partial outputs from agents to user-facing interfaces or applications.
-   **Incremental Rendering**: Updating user interfaces and displays to incrementally render or populate with newly streamed output segments, providing a seamless and real-time experience for end-users.

By delivering outputs as they are generated, streaming responses can significantly improve the perceived responsiveness and interactivity of multi-agent LLM deployments, even in scenarios where the overall processing time remains unchanged.

### Progress Indicators

In cases where streaming responses may not be feasible or appropriate, providing visual or textual indicators of ongoing processing and progress can help manage user expectations and improve the overall experience. Progress indicators can be implemented through techniques such as:

-   **Loader Animations**: Displaying simple animations or spinner graphics to indicate that processing is underway and provide a sense of activity and progress.
-   **Progress Bars**: Rendering progress bars or completion indicators based on estimated or actual progress through multi-agent workflows or processing pipelines.
-   **Status Updates**: Periodically updating user interfaces with textual status messages or descriptions of the current processing stage, providing users with a more detailed understanding of the system's activities.

Effective progress indicators require careful integration with monitoring and telemetry capabilities to accurately track and communicate the progress of multi-agent workflows, as well as thoughtful user experience design to ensure that indicators are clear, unobtrusive, and aligned with user expectations.

### Chunked Delivery

In scenarios where outputs or responses cannot be effectively streamed or rendered incrementally, chunked delivery can provide a middle ground between delivering the entire output at once and streaming individual tokens or characters. By breaking larger outputs into smaller, more manageable chunks and delivering them individually, enterprises can improve perceived responsiveness and provide a more engaging user experience.

Implementing chunked delivery involves:

-   **Output Segmentation**: Identifying logical breakpoints or segmentation boundaries within larger outputs, such as paragraphs, sections, or other structural elements.
-   **Chunking Mechanisms**: Integrating mechanisms to efficiently break outputs into individual chunks and transmit or render them sequentially, with minimal delay between chunks.
-   **Chunk Rendering**: Updating user interfaces or displays to seamlessly render or append new output chunks as they are received, providing a sense of continuous progress and minimizing the perception of extended waiting periods.

Chunked delivery can be particularly effective in scenarios where outputs are inherently structured or segmented, such as document generation, report creation, or multi-step instructions or workflows.

## Principle 7: Leverage Hybrid Approaches
---------------------------------------

While multi-agent LLM architectures offer numerous advantages, they should not be viewed as a one-size-fits-all solution. In many cases, combining LLM agents with traditional techniques, optimized components, or external services can yield superior performance, cost-effectiveness, and resource utilization compared to a pure LLM-based approach.

### Task Offloading

Certain tasks or subtasks within a larger multi-agent workflow may be more efficiently handled by dedicated, optimized components or external services, rather than relying solely on LLM agents. Task offloading involves identifying these opportunities and integrating the appropriate components or services into the overall architecture.

Examples of task offloading in multi-agent LLM deployments include:

-   **Regular Expression Matching**: Offloading pattern matching or text extraction tasks to dedicated regular expression engines, which can often outperform LLM-based approaches in terms of speed and efficiency.
-   **Structured Data Processing**: Leveraging specialized data processing engines or databases for tasks involving structured data, such as querying, filtering, or transforming tabular or relational data.
-   **External APIs and Services**: Integrating with external APIs or cloud services for specific tasks, such as speech recognition, translation, or knowledge base lookup, leveraging the specialized capabilities and optimizations of these dedicated services.

Effective task offloading requires a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of both LLM agents and traditional components, as well as careful consideration of integration points, data flows, and performance trade-offs within the overall multi-agent architecture.

### Caching and Indexing

While LLMs excel at generating dynamic, context-aware outputs, they can be less efficient when dealing with static or frequently accessed information or knowledge. Caching and indexing strategies can help mitigate this limitation by minimizing redundant LLM processing and enabling faster retrieval of commonly accessed data.

Techniques for leveraging caching and indexing in multi-agent LLM deployments include:

**Output Caching**: Caching the outputs or responses generated by LLM agents, allowing for rapid retrieval and reuse in cases where the same or similar input is encountered in the future.

**Knowledge Base Indexing**: Indexing domain-specific knowledge bases, data repositories, or other static information sources using traditional search and information retrieval techniques. This allows LLM agents to efficiently query and incorporate relevant information into their outputs, without needing to process or generate this content from scratch.

**Contextual Caching**: Caching not only outputs but also the contextual information and intermediate results generated during multi-agent workflows. This enables more efficient reuse and continuation of previous processing in scenarios where contexts are long-lived or recurring.

Implementing effective caching and indexing strategies requires careful consideration of data freshness, consistency, and invalidation mechanisms, as well as seamless integration with LLM agents and multi-agent workflows to ensure that cached or indexed data is appropriately leveraged and updated.

### Pre-computation and Lookup

In certain scenarios, especially those involving constrained or well-defined inputs, pre-computing and lookup strategies can be leveraged to minimize or entirely avoid the need for real-time LLM processing. By generating and storing potential outputs or responses in advance, enterprises can significantly improve performance and reduce resource consumption.

Approaches for pre-computation and lookup include:

**Output Pre-generation**: For inputs or scenarios with a limited set of potential outputs, pre-generating and storing all possible responses, allowing for rapid retrieval and delivery without the need for real-time LLM execution.

**Retrieval-Based Responses**: Developing retrieval models or techniques that can identify and surface pre-computed or curated responses based on input characteristics, leveraging techniques such as nearest neighbor search, embedding-based retrieval, or example-based generation.

**Hybrid Approaches**: Combining pre-computed or retrieved responses with real-time LLM processing, allowing for the generation of dynamic, context-aware content while still leveraging pre-computed components to optimize performance and resource utilization.

Effective implementation of pre-computation and lookup strategies requires careful analysis of input patterns, output distributions, and potential performance gains, as well as robust mechanisms for managing and updating pre-computed data as application requirements or domain knowledge evolves.

## Error Handling

The Swarms API client provides detailed error handling with specific exception types for different error scenarios. All exceptions inherit from the base `SwarmsError` class.

```python

try:
    client = SwarmsClient(api_key="invalid-api-key")
    response = client.agent.create(
        agent_config={"agent_name": "Researcher", "model_name": "gpt-4o"},
        task="Research quantum computing"
    )
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
except SwarmsError as e:
    print(f"Swarms error: {e}")
```

### Exception Types

| Exception | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `SwarmsError` | Base exception for all Swarms API errors |
| `AuthenticationError` | Raised when there's an issue with authentication |
| `RateLimitError` | Raised when the rate limit is exceeded |
| `APIError` | Raised when the API returns an error |
| `InvalidRequestError` | Raised when the request is invalid |
| `InsufficientCreditsError` | Raised when the user doesn't have enough credits |
| `TimeoutError` | Raised when a request times out |
| `NetworkError` | Raised when there's a network issue |

## Advanced Features

### Connection Pooling

The Swarms API client uses connection pooling to efficiently manage HTTP connections, which can significantly improve performance when making multiple requests.

```python
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    pool_connections=100,  # Number of connection pools to cache
    pool_maxsize=100,      # Maximum number of connections to save in the pool
    keep_alive_timeout=5   # Keep-alive timeout for connections in seconds
)
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The client implements the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when the API is experiencing issues.

```python
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    circuit_breaker_threshold=5,  # Number of failures before the circuit opens
    circuit_breaker_timeout=60    # Time in seconds before attempting to close the circuit
)
```

### Caching

The client includes in-memory caching for frequently accessed resources to reduce API calls and improve performance.

```python
client = SwarmsClient(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    enable_cache=True  # Enable in-memory caching
)

# Clear the cache manually if needed
client.clear_cache()
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use the Swarms API client to create a research swarm and process its output:

```python
import os
from swarms_client import SwarmsClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API key from environment
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY")

# Initialize client
client = SwarmsClient(api_key=api_key)

# Create a research swarm
try:
    # Define the agents
    researcher = {
        "agent_name": "Researcher",
        "description": "Conducts thorough research on specified topics",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
        "temperature": 0.5,
        "system_prompt": "You are a diligent researcher focused on finding accurate and comprehensive information."
    }
    
    analyst = {
        "agent_name": "Analyst",
        "description": "Analyzes research findings and identifies key insights",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o",
        "temperature": 0.3,
        "system_prompt": "You are an insightful analyst who can identify patterns and extract meaningful insights from research data."
    }
    
    summarizer = {
        "agent_name": "Summarizer",
        "description": "Creates concise summaries of complex information",
        "model_name": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "temperature": 0.4,
        "system_prompt": "You specialize in distilling complex information into clear, concise summaries."
    }
    
    # Create the swarm
    response = client.swarm.create(
        name="Quantum Computing Research Swarm",
        description="A swarm for researching and analyzing quantum computing advancements",
        swarm_type="SequentialWorkflow",
        task="Research the latest advancements in quantum computing in 2024, analyze their potential impact on cryptography and data security, and provide a concise summary of the findings.",
        agents=[researcher, analyst, summarizer],
        max_loops=2,
        return_history=True
    )
    
    # Process the response
    print(f"Job ID: {response.job_id}")
    print(f"Status: {response.status}")
    print(f"Number of agents: {response.number_of_agents}")
    print(f"Swarm type: {response.swarm_type}")
    
    # Print the output
    if "final_output" in response.output:
        print("\nFinal Output:")
        print(response.output["final_output"])
    else:
        print("\nOutput:")
        print(response.output)
    
    # Access agent-specific outputs if available
    if "agent_outputs" in response.output:
        print("\nAgent Outputs:")
        for agent, output in response.output["agent_outputs"].items():
            print(f"\n{agent}:")
            print(output)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example creates a sequential workflow swarm with three agents to research quantum computing, analyze the findings, and create a summary of the results.

## Multi-Agent Swarms

!!! tip "Swarm Types"

    Swarms API supports two types of agent workflows:
    
    1. `SequentialWorkflow`: Agents work in sequence, each building on previous output
    2. `ConcurrentWorkflow`: Agents work in parallel on the same task

### Sequential Workflow

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1" title="sequential_swarm.py"
    def run_sequential_swarm():
        payload = {

                    "system_prompt": "You are a financial analyst expert.",
                    "model_name": "gpt-4o",
                    "role": "worker",
                    "max_loops": 1,
                    "max_tokens": 8192,

                    "description": "Predicts economic trends",
                    "system_prompt": "You are an expert in economic forecasting.",

                }
            ],
            "max_loops": 1,
            "swarm_type": "SequentialWorkflow",  # (3)
            "task": "Analyze the current market conditions and provide economic forecasts."

            headers=headers,
            json=payload
        )
        return response.json()
    ```

    1. First agent analyzes market trends
    2. Second agent builds on first agent's analysis
    3. Sequential workflow ensures ordered execution

## Best Practices

!!! danger "Security"
    Never commit API keys or sensitive credentials to version control.

!!! warning "Rate Limits"
    Implement proper rate limiting and error handling in production.

!!! tip "Testing"
    Start with simple tasks and gradually increase complexity.

=== "Python"

    ```python linenums="1" title="best_practices.py"
    # Error Handling
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

    # Rate Limiting
    import time
    from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential

    @retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
    def make_api_call():
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response

    # Input Validation
    def validate_payload(payload):
        required_fields = ["agent_config", "task"]
        if not all(field in payload for field in required_fields):
            raise ValueError("Missing required fields")
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```typescript linenums="1" title="best_practices.ts"
    // Error Handling
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(url, payload, { headers });
    } catch (error) {
      if (axios.isAxiosError(error)) {
        console.error('API Error:', error.response?.data);
      }
      throw error;
    }

    // Rate Limiting
    import { rateLimit } from 'axios-rate-limit';

    const http = rateLimit(axios.create(), { 
      maxRequests: 2,
      perMilliseconds: 1000
    });

    // Input Validation
    function validatePayload(payload: unknown): asserts payload is AgentPayload {
      if (!payload || typeof payload !== 'object') {
        throw new Error('Invalid payload');
      }

      const { agent_config, task } = payload as Partial<AgentPayload>;
      
      if (!agent_config || !task) {
        throw new Error('Missing required fields');

# Swarms API Rate Limits 

The Swarms API implements a comprehensive rate limiting system that tracks API requests across multiple time windows and enforces various limits to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## Rate Limits Summary

| Rate Limit Type | Free Tier | Premium Tier | Time Window | Description |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Requests per Minute** | 100 | 2,000 | 1 minute | Maximum API calls per minute |
| **Requests per Hour** | 50 | 10,000 | 1 hour | Maximum API calls per hour |
| **Requests per Day** | 1,200 | 100,000 | 24 hours | Maximum API calls per day |
| **Tokens per Agent** | 200,000 | 2,000,000 | Per request | Maximum tokens per agent |
| **Prompt Length** | 200,000 | 200,000 | Per request | Maximum input tokens per request |
| **Batch Size** | 10 | 10 | Per request | Maximum agents in batch requests |
| **IP-based Fallback** | 100 | 100 | 60 seconds | For requests without API keys |

## Detailed Rate Limit Explanations

### 1. **Request Rate Limits**

These limits control how many API calls you can make within specific time windows.

#### **Per-Minute Limit**

| Tier         | Requests per Minute | Reset Interval         | Applies To         |
|--------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Free         | 100                | Every minute (sliding) | All API endpoints  |
| Premium      | 2,000              | Every minute (sliding) | All API endpoints  |

#### **Per-Hour Limit**

- **Free Tier**: 50 requests per hour
- **Premium Tier**: 10,000 requests per hour
- **Reset**: Every hour (sliding window)
- **Applies to**: All API endpoints

#### **Per-Day Limit**

- **Free Tier**: 1,200 requests per day (50 × 24)

- **Premium Tier**: 100,000 requests per day

- **Reset**: Every 24 hours (sliding window)

- **Applies to**: All API endpoints

### 2. **Token Limits**

These limits control the amount of text processing allowed per request.

#### **Tokens per Agent**

- **Free Tier**: 200,000 tokens per agent

- **Premium Tier**: 2,000,000 tokens per agent

- **Applies to**: Individual agent configurations

- **Includes**: System prompts, task descriptions, and agent names

#### **Prompt Length Limit**

- **All Tiers**: 200,000 tokens maximum

- **Applies to**: Combined input text (task + history + system prompts)

- **Error**: Returns 400 error if exceeded

- **Message**: "Prompt is too long. Please provide a prompt that is less than 10000 tokens."

### 3. **Batch Processing Limits**

These limits control concurrent processing capabilities.

#### **Batch Size Limit**

- **All Tiers**: 10 agents maximum per batch

- **Applies to**: `/v1/agent/batch/completions` endpoint

- **Error**: Returns 400 error if exceeded

- **Message**: "ERROR: BATCH SIZE EXCEEDED - You can only run up to 10 batch agents at a time."

## How Rate Limiting Works

### Database-Based Tracking

The system uses a database-based approach for API key requests:

1. **Request Logging**: Every API request is logged to the `swarms_api_logs` table
2. **Time Window Queries**: The system queries for requests in the last minute, hour, and day
3. **Limit Comparison**: Current counts are compared against configured limits
4. **Request Blocking**: Requests are blocked if any limit is exceeded

### Sliding Windows

Rate limits use sliding windows rather than fixed windows:

- **Minute**: Counts requests in the last 60 seconds

- **Hour**: Counts requests in the last 60 minutes  

- **Day**: Counts requests in the last 24 hours

This provides more accurate rate limiting compared to fixed time windows.

## Checking Your Rate Limits

### API Endpoint

Use the `/v1/rate/limits` endpoint to check your current usage:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
     https://api.swarms.world/v1/rate/limits
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rate_limits": {
    "minute": {
      "count": 5,
      "limit": 100,
      "exceeded": false,
      "remaining": 95,
      "reset_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "hour": {
      "count": 25,
      "limit": 50,
      "exceeded": false,
      "remaining": 25,
      "reset_time": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
    },
    "day": {
      "count": 150,
      "limit": 1200,
      "exceeded": false,
      "remaining": 1050,
      "reset_time": "2024-01-16T10:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "limits": {
    "maximum_requests_per_minute": 100,
    "maximum_requests_per_hour": 50,
    "maximum_requests_per_day": 1200,
    "tokens_per_agent": 200000
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:29:30Z"
}
```

## Handling Rate Limit Errors

### Error Response

When rate limits are exceeded, you'll receive a 429 status code:

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded for minute window(s). Upgrade to Premium for increased limits (2,000/min, 10,000/hour, 100,000/day) at https://swarms.world/platform/account for just $99/month."
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your rate limits using the `/v1/rate/limits` endpoint
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff when hitting rate limits
3. **Optimize Requests**: Combine multiple operations into single requests when possible
4. **Upgrade When Needed**: Consider upgrading to Premium for higher limits

## Premium Tier Benefits

Upgrade to Premium for significantly higher limits:

- **20x more requests per minute** (2,000 vs 100)

- **200x more requests per hour** (10,000 vs 50)

- **83x more requests per day** (100,000 vs 1,200)

- **10x more tokens per agent** (2M vs 200K)

Visit [Swarms Platform Account](https://swarms.world/platform/account) to upgrade for just $99/month.

## Performance Considerations

- Database queries are optimized to only count request IDs
- Rate limit checks are cached per request
- Fallback mechanisms ensure system reliability
- Minimal impact on request latency
- Persistent tracking across server restarts

### 4. Batch Processing

```rust
use swarms_client::{SwarmsClient, AgentCompletion, AgentSpec};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = SwarmsClient::builder()
        .unwrap()
        .from_env()?
        .max_concurrent_requests(20) // Allow more concurrent requests for batch
        .build()?;

    // Create multiple agent completion requests
    let requests = vec![
        AgentCompletion {
            agent_config: AgentSpec {
                agent_name: "Content Creator 1".to_string(),
                model_name: "gpt-4o-mini".to_string(),
                temperature: 0.7,
                max_tokens: 1000,
                ..Default::default()
            },
            task: "Write a social media post about renewable energy".to_string(),
            history: None,
        },
        AgentCompletion {
            agent_config: AgentSpec {
                agent_name: "Content Creator 2".to_string(),

        println!("Tokens used: {}\n", response.usage.total_tokens);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Custom Configuration with Error Handling

```rust
use swarms_client::{SwarmsClient, SwarmsError, ClientConfig};
use std::time::Duration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Custom configuration for production use
    let config = ClientConfig {
        api_key: std::env::var("SWARMS_API_KEY")?,
        base_url: "https://swarms-api-285321057562.us-east1.run.app/".parse()?,
        timeout: Duration::from_secs(180),
        max_retries: 5,
        retry_delay: Duration::from_secs(2),
        max_concurrent_requests: 50,
        circuit_breaker_threshold: 10,
        circuit_breaker_timeout: Duration::from_secs(120),
        enable_cache: true,
        cache_ttl: Duration::from_secs(600),
    };

    let client = SwarmsClient::with_config(config)?;

    // Example with comprehensive error handling
    match client.swarm()
        .completion()
        .name("Production Swarm")
        .swarm_type(SwarmType::Auto)
        .task("Analyze market trends for Q4 2024")
        .agent(|agent| {
            agent
                .name("Market Analyst")
                .model("gpt-4o")
                .temperature(0.5)
        })
        .send()
        .await
    {
        Ok(response) => {
            println!("Success! Job ID: {}", response.job_id);
            println!("Output: {}", response.output);
        },
        Err(SwarmsError::Authentication { message, .. }) => {
            eprintln!("Authentication error: {}", message);
        },
        Err(SwarmsError::RateLimit { message, .. }) => {
            eprintln!("Rate limit exceeded: {}", message);
            // Implement backoff strategy
        },
        Err(SwarmsError::InsufficientCredits { message, .. }) => {
            eprintln!("Insufficient credits: {}", message);
        },
        Err(SwarmsError::CircuitBreakerOpen) => {
            eprintln!("Circuit breaker is open - service temporarily unavailable");
        },
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Other error: {}", e);
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### 6. Monitoring and Observability

```rust
use swarms_client::SwarmsClient;
use tracing::{info, warn, error};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize tracing for observability
    tracing_subscriber::init();

    let client = SwarmsClient::builder()
        .unwrap()
        .from_env()?
        .enable_cache(true)
        .build()?;

    // Monitor cache performance
    if let Some((valid, total)) = client.cache_stats() {
        info!("Cache stats: {}/{} entries valid", valid, total);
    }

    // Make request with monitoring
    let start = std::time::Instant::now();
    
    let response = client.swarm()
        .completion()
        .name("Monitored Swarm")
        .task("Analyze system performance metrics")
        .agent(|agent| {
            agent
                .name("Performance Analyst")
                .model("gpt-4o-mini")
        })
        .send()
        .await?;

    let duration = start.elapsed();
    info!("Request completed in {:?}", duration);
    
    if duration > Duration::from_secs(30) {
        warn!("Request took longer than expected: {:?}", duration);
    }

    // Clear cache periodically in production
    client.clear_cache();
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Error Handling

The client provides comprehensive error handling with specific error types:

### SwarmsError Types

| Error Type | Description | Recommended Action |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `Authentication` | Invalid API key or authentication failure | Check API key and permissions |
| `RateLimit` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement exponential backoff |
| `InvalidRequest` | Malformed request parameters | Validate input parameters |
| `InsufficientCredits` | Not enough credits for operation | Check account balance |
| `Api` | General API error | Check API status and retry |
| `Network` | Network connectivity issues | Check internet connection |
| `Timeout` | Request timeout | Increase timeout or retry |
| `CircuitBreakerOpen` | Circuit breaker preventing requests | Wait for recovery period |
| `Serialization` | JSON serialization/deserialization error | Check data format |

### Error Handling Best Practices

```rust
use swarms_client::{SwarmsClient, SwarmsError};

async fn handle_swarm_request(client: &SwarmsClient, task: &str) -> Result<String, SwarmsError> {
    match client.swarm()
        .completion()
        .task(task)
        .agent(|agent| agent.name("Worker").model("gpt-4o-mini"))
        .send()
        .await
    {
        Ok(response) => Ok(response.output.to_string()),
        Err(SwarmsError::RateLimit { .. }) => {
            // Implement exponential backoff
            tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            Err(SwarmsError::RateLimit {
                message: "Rate limited - should retry".to_string(),
                status: Some(429),
                request_id: None,
            })
        },
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}
```

## Performance Features

### Connection Pooling
The client automatically manages HTTP connection pooling for optimal performance:

```rust
// Connections are automatically pooled and reused
let client = SwarmsClient::builder()
    .unwrap()
    .from_env()?
    .max_concurrent_requests(100) // Allow up to 100 concurrent requests
    .build()?;
```

### Caching
Intelligent caching reduces redundant API calls:

```rust
let client = SwarmsClient::builder()
    .unwrap()
    .from_env()?
    .enable_cache(true)
    .cache_ttl(Duration::from_secs(300)) // 5-minute TTL
    .build()?;

// GET requests are automatically cached
let models = client.models().list().await?; // First call hits API
let models_cached = client.models().list().await?; // Second call uses cache
```

### Circuit Breaker
Automatic failure detection and recovery:

```rust
let client = SwarmsClient::builder()
    .unwrap()
    .from_env()?
    .build()?;

// Circuit breaker automatically opens after 5 failures
// and recovers after 60 seconds
```

# Swarms API with Tools Guide


Swarms API allows you to create and manage AI agent swarms with optional tool integration. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the Swarms API with tools.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Swarms API key
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`

  - `python-dotenv`

## Installation & Setup

1. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

2. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
SWARMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Basic setup code:

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json

load_dotenv()

API_KEY = os.getenv("SWARMS_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "https://api.swarms.world"

headers = {"x-api-key": API_KEY, "Content-Type": "application/json"}
```

## Creating a Swarm with Tools

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Define your tool dictionary:
```python
tool_dictionary = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "search_topic",
        "description": "Conduct an in-depth search on a specified topic",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "depth": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "description": "Search depth (1-3)"
                },
                "detailed_queries": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Specific search queries"
                    }
                }
            },
            "required": ["depth", "detailed_queries"]
        }
    }
}
```

2. Create agent configurations:
```python
agent_config = {
    "agent_name": "Market Analyst",
    "description": "Analyzes market trends",
    "system_prompt": "You are a financial analyst expert.",
    "model_name": "openai/gpt-4",
    "role": "worker",
    "max_loops": 1,
    "max_tokens": 8192,
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "auto_generate_prompt": False,
    "tools_dictionary": [tool_dictionary]  # Optional: Add tools if needed
}
```

3. Create the swarm payload:
```python
payload = {
    "name": "Your Swarm Name",
    "description": "Swarm description",
    "agents": [agent_config],
    "max_loops": 1,
    "swarm_type": "ConcurrentWorkflow",
    "task": "Your task description",
    "output_type": "dict"
}
```

4. Make the API request:
```python
def run_swarm(payload):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

## FAQ

### Do all agents need tools?
No, tools are optional for each agent. You can choose which agents have tools based on your specific needs. Simply omit the `tools_dictionary` field for agents that don't require tools.

### What types of tools can I use?
Currently, the API supports function-type tools. Each tool must have:
- A unique name

- A clear description

- Well-defined parameters with types and descriptions

### Can I mix agents with and without tools?
Yes, you can create swarms with a mix of tool-enabled and regular agents. This allows for flexible swarm architectures.

### What's the recommended number of tools per agent?
While there's no strict limit, it's recommended to:

- Keep tools focused and specific

- Only include tools that the agent needs

- Consider the complexity of tool interactions

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of a financial analysis swarm:

```python
def run_financial_analysis_swarm():
    payload = {
        "name": "Financial Analysis Swarm",
        "description": "Market analysis swarm",
        "agents": [
            {
                "agent_name": "Market Analyst",
                "description": "Analyzes market trends",
                "system_prompt": "You are a financial analyst expert.",
                "model_name": "openai/gpt-4",
                "role": "worker",
                "max_loops": 1,
                "max_tokens": 8192,
                "temperature": 0.5,
                "auto_generate_prompt": False,
                "tools_dictionary": [
                    {
                        "type": "function",
                        "function": {
                            "name": "search_topic",
                            "description": "Conduct market research",
                            "parameters": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {
                                    "depth": {
                                        "type": "integer",
                                        "description": "Search depth (1-3)"
                                    },
                                    "detailed_queries": {
                                        "type": "array",
                                        "items": {"type": "string"}
                                    }
                                },
                                "required": ["depth", "detailed_queries"]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "max_loops": 1,
        "swarm_type": "ConcurrentWorkflow",
        "task": "Analyze top performing tech ETFs",
        "output_type": "dict"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    return response.json()
```

## Health Check

Always verify the API status before running swarms:

```python
def check_api_health():
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/health", headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling:
```python
def safe_run_swarm(payload):
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{BASE_URL}/v1/swarm/completions",
            headers=headers,
            json=payload
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error running swarm: {e}")
        return None
```

2. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode API keys

3. **Tool Design**: Keep tools simple and focused

4. **Testing**: Validate swarm configurations before production use

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify key is correctly set in `.env`

   - Check key permissions

2. **Tool Execution Errors**
   - Validate tool parameters

   - Check tool function signatures

3. **Response Timeout**
   - Consider reducing max_tokens

   - Simplify tool complexity

# The Swarms Cloud and Agent Marketplace

We stand at the dawn of a new era—the **Agentic Economy**, where the power of intelligent automation is in the hands of everyone. The Swarms Cloud and Agent Marketplace will serve as the epicenter of this economy, enabling developers, businesses, and creators to easily publish, discover, and leverage intelligent agents. Our vision is to make publishing agents as simple as possible through an intuitive CLI, while empowering users to generate income by posting their APIs on the marketplace.

The Swarms Marketplace is more than just a platform—it’s a **revolutionary ecosystem** that will change how we think about automation and intelligence. By building this platform, we aim to democratize access to agent-driven solutions, enabling a seamless bridge between creators and consumers of automation. With every agent posted to the marketplace, a ripple effect is created, driving innovation across industries and providing an unparalleled opportunity for monetization.

---

### The Agent Marketplace

#### A Unified Platform for Automation

In the Swarms Marketplace, **agents will be the new currency of efficiency**. Whether you’re building agents for marketing, finance, customer service, or any other domain, the Swarms Cloud will allow you to showcase your agentic APIs, easily discoverable by anyone needing those capabilities.

We envision the marketplace to function like an API store, where users can search for specific agent capabilities, purchase access to agents, or even integrate their existing systems with agent-based APIs that others have developed. Each agent you publish will come with a potential income stream as businesses and developers integrate your creations into their workflows.

#### The Opportunity to Monetize Your APIs

The Swarms Marketplace is designed to let developers and businesses generate income by sharing their agent APIs. Once your agent is published to the marketplace, other users can browse, test, and integrate it into their operations. You will be able to set custom pricing, usage tiers, and licensing terms for your API, ensuring you can profit from your innovations.

Our vision for monetization includes:

- **API subscriptions**: Allow users to subscribe to your agent API with recurring payments.

- **Per-use pricing**: Offer users a pay-as-you-go model where they only pay for the API calls they use.

- **Licensing**: Enable others to purchase full access to your agent for a set period or on a project basis.

### Publishing Agents: Simplicity Through CLI

The complexity of deploying agents to a marketplace should never be a barrier. Our goal is to **streamline the publishing process** into something as simple as a command-line interaction. The Swarms CLI will be your one-stop solution to get your agent up and running on the marketplace.

#### CLI Workflow:

1. **Create an Agent**: Build your agent using the Swarms framework or any custom framework of your choice.
2. **Set Agent Metadata**: Through the CLI, input the metadata about your agent, including its capabilities, pricing, and target industries.
3. **Publish to Marketplace**: Run the simple `swarms publish` command to instantly deploy your agent to the marketplace.
4. **Monitor Usage and Income**: Use the Swarms Cloud dashboard to view your agent's interactions, track API usage, and receive payouts.

Here’s an example of how easy publishing will be:

```bash
$ swarms create-agent --name "CustomerSupportAgent" --type "LLM" 
$ swarms set-metadata --description "An intelligent agent for customer support operations" --pricing "subscription" --rate "$20/month"
$ swarms publish
```

Within minutes, your agent will be live and accessible to the global marketplace!

## Usage


The `PineconeMemory` class is initialized with the necessary parameters to configure Pinecone and the embedding model. It supports a variety of custom configurations to suit different needs.

#### Example

```python
from swarms_memory import PineconeMemory

# Initialize PineconeMemory
memory = PineconeMemory(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    environment="us-west1-gcp",
    index_name="example-index",
    dimension=768
)
```

### Adding Documents

Documents can be added to the Pinecone index using the `add` method. The method accepts a document string and optional metadata.

#### Example

```python
doc = "This is a sample document to be added to the Pinecone index."
metadata = {"author": "John Doe", "date": "2024-07-08"}

memory.add(doc, metadata)
```

### Querying Documents

The `query` method allows for querying the Pinecone index for similar documents based on a query string. It returns the top `k` most similar documents.

#### Example

```python
query = "Sample query to find similar documents."
results = memory.query(query, top_k=5)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

## Additional Information and Tips

### Custom Embedding and Preprocessing Functions

Custom embedding and preprocessing functions can be provided during initialization to tailor the document processing to specific requirements.

#### Example

```python
def custom_embedding_function(text: str) -> List[float]:
    # Custom embedding logic
    return [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

def custom_preprocess_function(text: str) -> str:
    # Custom preprocessing logic
    return text.lower()

memory = PineconeMemory(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    environment="us-west1-gcp",
    index_name="example-index",
    embedding_function=custom_embedding_function,
    preprocess_function=custom_preprocess_function
)
```

### Logger Configuration

The logger can be configured to suit different logging needs. The default configuration logs to a file and the console.

#### Example

```python
logger_config = {
    "handlers": [
        {"sink": "custom_log.log", "rotation": "1 MB"},
        {"sink": lambda msg: print(msg, end="")},
    ]
}

memory = PineconeMemory(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    environment="us-west1-gcp",
    index_name="example-index",
    logger_config=logger_config
)
```

# Documentation for `getAllAgents` API Endpoint

The `getAllAgents` API endpoint is a part of the `swarms.world` application, designed to fetch all agent records from the database. This endpoint is crucial for retrieving various agents stored in the `swarms_cloud_agents` table, including their metadata such as name, description, use cases, language, requirements and tags. It provides an authenticated way to access this data, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve the information.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this API endpoint is to provide a method for clients to fetch a list of agents stored in the `swarms_cloud_agents` table, with the ability to filter by name, tags, language, requirement package and use cases. It ensures data integrity and security by using an authentication guard and handles various HTTP methods and errors gracefully.

## API Endpoint Definition

### Fetch All Agents

#### Endpoint URL

```
https://swarms.world/get-agents
```

#### HTTP Method

```
GET
```

### Request Headers

| Header        | Type   | Required | Description                 |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Authorization | String | Yes      | Bearer token for API access |

### Query Parameters

- **name** (optional): A substring to match against the agent name. The query is case-insensitive.
- **tag** (optional): A comma-separated list of tags to filter agents by. The query matches any of the provided tags, and is case-insensitive.
- **language** (optional): A substring to match against the language the agent is written in. The query is case-insensitive.
- **use_case** (optional): A substring to match against the use case titles within the `use_cases` array. The query is case-insensitive.
- **req_package** (optional): A substring to match against the requirement packaages within the `requirements` array. The query is case-insensitive.

#### Response

##### Success Response (200)

Returns an array of agents.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "language": "string",
    "agent": "string",
    "use_cases": [
      {
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "requirements": [
      {
        "package": "string",
        "installation": "string"
      }
    ],
    "tags": "string"
  },
  ...
]
```

##### Error Responses

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Method <method> Not Allowed"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Could not fetch agents"
  }
  ```

### Fetch Agent by ID

#### Endpoint URL

```
https://swarms.world/get-agents/[id]
```

#### HTTP Method

```
GET
```

### Request Headers

| Header        | Type   | Required | Description                 |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Authorization | String | Yes      | Bearer token for API access |

#### Response

##### Success Response (200)

Returns a single agent by ID.

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "language": "string",
  "agent": "string",
  "use_cases": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "requirements": [
    {
      "package": "string",
      "installation": "string"
    }
  ],
  "tags": "string"
}
```

##### Error Responses

- **404 Not Found**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Agent not found"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Could not fetch agent"
  }
  ```

### Request Handling

1. **Method Validation**: The endpoint only supports the `GET` method. If a different HTTP method is used, it responds with a `405 Method Not Allowed` status.

2. **Database Query**:

   - **Fetching All Agents**: The endpoint uses the `supabaseAdmin` client to query the `swarms_cloud_agents` table. Filters are applied based on the query parameters (`name`, `tag`, `language`, `req_package` and `use_case`).
   - **Fetching an Agent by ID**: The endpoint retrieves a single agent from the `swarms_cloud_agents` table by its unique ID.

3. **Response**: On success, it returns the agent data in JSON format. In case of an error during the database query, a `500 Internal Server Error` status is returned. For fetching by ID, if the agent is not found, it returns a `404 Not Found` status.

### Code Example

#### JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

// Fetch all agents with optional filters
const getAgents = async (filters) => {

   Navigate to [https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys](https://swarms.world/platform/api-keys).

3. **Generate a New Key:**  
   Click on the **"Create new API key"** button. The system will generate a new secret API key for your account.

4. **Store Your API Key Securely:**  
   Once generated, the full API key will be displayed only once. Copy and store it in a secure location, as it will not be displayed again.  
   **Note:** Do not share your API key with anyone or expose it in any client-side code (e.g., browser JavaScript).

---

## Security Guidelines

- **Confidentiality:**  
  Your API keys are sensitive credentials. Do not share them with anyone or include them in public repositories or client-side code.

- **Storage:**  
  Store your API keys in secure, encrypted storage. Avoid saving them in plain text files or unsecured locations.

- **Rotation:**  
  If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, immediately delete it and create a new one.

- **Access Control:**  
  Limit access to your API keys to only those systems and personnel who absolutely require it.

# Documentation for `getAllPrompts` API Endpoint

The `getAllPrompts` API endpoint is a part of the `swarms.world` application, designed to fetch all prompt records from the database. This endpoint is crucial for retrieving various prompts stored in the `swarms_cloud_prompts` table, including their metadata such as name, description, use cases, and tags.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this API endpoint is to provide a method for clients to fetch a list of prompts stored in the `swarms_cloud_prompts` table, with the ability to filter by name, tags, and use cases.

## API Endpoint Definition

### Fetch All Prompts

#### Endpoint URL

```
https://swarms.world/get-prompts
```

#### HTTP Method

```
GET
```

### Query Parameters

- **name** (optional): A substring to match against the prompt name. The query is case-insensitive.
- **tag** (optional): A comma-separated list of tags to filter prompts by. The query matches any of the provided tags, and is case-insensitive.
- **use_case** (optional): A substring to match against the use case titles within the `use_cases` array. The query is case-insensitive.
- **use_case_description** (optional): A substring to match against the use case descriptions within the `use_cases` array. The query is case-insensitive.

#### Response

##### Success Response (200)

Returns an array of prompts.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "prompt": "string",
    "use_cases": [
      {
        "title": "string",
        "description": "string"
      }
    ],
    "tags": "string"
  },
  ...
]
```

##### Error Responses

- **405 Method Not Allowed**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Method <method> Not Allowed"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Could not fetch prompts"
  }
  ```

### Fetch Prompt by ID

#### Endpoint URL

```
https://swarms.world/get-prompts/[id]
```

#### HTTP Method

```
GET
```

#### Response

##### Success Response (200)

Returns a single prompt by ID.

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "prompt": "string",
  "use_cases": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string"
    }
  ],
  "tags": "string"
}
```

##### Error Responses

- **404 Not Found**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Prompt not found"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Could not fetch prompt"
  }
  ```

### Request Handling

1. **Method Validation**: The endpoint only supports the `GET` method. If a different HTTP method is used, it responds with a `405 Method Not Allowed` status.

2. **Database Query**:

   - **Fetching All Prompts**: The endpoint uses the `supabaseAdmin` client to query the `swarms_cloud_prompts` table. Filters are applied based on the query parameters (`name`, `tag`, and `use_cases`).
   - **Fetching a Prompt by ID**: The endpoint retrieves a single prompt from the `swarms_cloud_prompts` table by its unique ID.

3. **Response**: On success, it returns the prompt data in JSON format. In case of an error during the database query, a `500 Internal Server Error` status is returned. For fetching by ID, if the prompt is not found, it returns a `404 Not Found` status.

### Code Example

#### JavaScript (Node.js)

```javascript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

// Fetch all prompts with optional filters
const getPrompts = async (filters) => {
  const queryString = new URLSearchParams(filters).toString();
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://swarms.world/get-prompts?${queryString}`,
    {
      method: "GET",
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
};

// Fetch prompt by ID
const getPromptById = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://swarms.world/get-prompts/${id}`, {
    method: "GET",
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);

        .system_prompt("You are a helpful assistant.")
        .agent_name("BasicAgent")
        .user_name("User")
        .build();
    
    // Run the agent with a user query
    let response = agent
        .run("Tell me about Rust programming.".to_owned())
        .await?;
    
    println!("{}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Agents

Agents in swarms-rs are autonomous entities that can:

- Perform complex reasoning based on LLM capabilities
- Use tools to interact with external systems
- Maintain persistent memory
- Execute multi-step plans

## Agent Configuration

### Core Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `system_prompt` | Initial instructions/role for the agent | - | Yes |
| `agent_name` | Name identifier for the agent | - | Yes |
| `user_name` | Name for the user interacting with agent | - | Yes |
| `max_loops` | Maximum number of reasoning loops | 1 | No |
| `retry_attempts` | Number of retry attempts on failure | 1 | No |
| `enable_autosave` | Enable state persistence | false | No |
| `save_state_dir` | Directory for saving agent state | None | No |

### Advanced Configuration

You can enhance your agent's capabilities with:

- **Planning**: Enable structured planning for complex tasks
- **Memory**: Persistent storage for agent state
- **Tools**: External capabilities through MCP protocol

!!! warning "Resource Usage"
    Setting high values for `max_loops` can increase API usage and costs. Start with lower values and adjust as needed.

## Examples

### Specialized Agent for Cryptocurrency Analysis

```rust
use std::env;
use anyhow::Result;
use swarms_rs::{llm::provider::openai::OpenAI, structs::agent::Agent};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::from_default_env())
        .with(
            tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
                .with_line_number(true)
                .with_file(true),
        )
        .init();

    let api_key = env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY").expect("OPENAI_API_KEY must be set");
    let client = OpenAI::new(api_key).set_model("gpt-4-turbo");
    
    let agent = client
        .agent_builder()
        .system_prompt(
            "You are a sophisticated cryptocurrency analysis assistant specialized in:

        .await?;
        
    println!("{}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Using Tools with MCP

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

swarms-rs supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling agents to interact with external tools through standardized interfaces.

!!! info "What is MCP?"
    MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools, giving your agents access to real-world data and capabilities beyond language processing.

### Supported MCP Server Types

- **STDIO MCP Servers**: Connect to command-line tools implementing the MCP protocol
- **SSE MCP Servers**: Connect to web-based MCP servers using Server-Sent Events

### Tool Integration

Add tools to your agent during configuration:

```rust
let agent = client
    .agent_builder()
    .system_prompt("You are a helpful assistant with access to tools.")
    .agent_name("ToolAgent")
    .user_name("User")
    // Add STDIO MCP server
    .add_stdio_mcp_server("uvx", ["mcp-hn"])
    .await
    // Add SSE MCP server
    .add_sse_mcp_server("file-browser", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse")
    .await
    .build();
```

### Full MCP Agent Example

```rust
use std::env;
use anyhow::Result;
use swarms_rs::{llm::provider::openai::OpenAI, structs::agent::Agent};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::from_default_env())
        .with(
            tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
                .with_line_number(true)
                .with_file(true),
        )
        .init();

    let api_key = env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY").expect("OPENAI_API_KEY must be set");
    let client = OpenAI::new(api_key).set_model("gpt-4-turbo");
    
    let agent = client
        .agent_builder()
        .system_prompt("You are a helpful assistant with access to news and file system tools.")
        .agent_name("SwarmsAgent")
        .user_name("User")
        // Add Hacker News tool
        .add_stdio_mcp_server("uvx", ["mcp-hn"])
        .await
        // Add filesystem tool
        // To set up: uvx mcp-proxy --sse-port=8000 -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~
        .add_sse_mcp_server("file-browser", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse")
        .await
        .retry_attempts(2)
        .max_loops(3)
        .build();

    // Use the news tool
    let news_response = agent
        .run("Get the top 3 stories of today from Hacker News".to_owned())
        .await?;
    println!("NEWS RESPONSE:\n{}", news_response);

    // Use the filesystem tool
    let fs_response = agent.run("List files in my home directory".to_owned()).await?;
    println!("FILESYSTEM RESPONSE:\n{}", fs_response);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Setting Up MCP Tools

### Installing MCP Servers

To use MCP servers with swarms-rs, you'll need to install the appropriate tools:

1. **uv Package Manager**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/uv/main/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **MCP-HN** (Hacker News MCP server):
   ```bash
   uvx install mcp-hn
   ```

3. **Setting up an SSE MCP server**:
   ```bash
   # Start file system MCP server over SSE
   uvx mcp-proxy --sse-port=8000 -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem ~
   ```

## FAQ

### General Questions

??? question "What LLM providers are supported?"
    swarms-rs currently supports:
    
    - OpenAI (GPT models)
    
    - DeepSeek AI
    
    - More providers coming soon

??? question "How does state persistence work?"
    When `enable_autosave` is set to `true`, the agent will save its state to the directory specified in `save_state_dir`. This includes conversation history and tool states, allowing the agent to resume from where it left off.

??? question "What is the difference between `max_loops` and `retry_attempts`?"
    - `max_loops`: Controls how many reasoning steps the agent can take for a single query
    
    - `retry_attempts`: Specifies how many times the agent will retry if an error occurs

### MCP Tools

??? question "How do I create my own MCP server?"
    You can create your own MCP server by implementing the MCP protocol. Check out the [MCP documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/spec) for details on the protocol specification.

??? question "Can I use tools without MCP?"
    Currently, swarms-rs is designed to use the MCP protocol for tool integration. This provides a standardized way for agents to interact with external systems.

## Advanced Topics

### Performance Optimization

Optimize your agent's performance by:

1. **Crafting Effective System Prompts**:
   - Be specific about the agent's role and capabilities
   
   - Include clear instructions on how to use available tools
   
   - Define success criteria for the agent's responses

2. **Tuning Loop Parameters**:
   
   - Start with lower values for `max_loops` and increase as needed
   
   - Consider the complexity of tasks when setting loop limits

3. **Strategic Tool Integration**:
   
   - Only integrate tools that are necessary for the agent's tasks
   
   - Provide clear documentation in the system prompt about when to use each tool

### Security Considerations

!!! danger "Security Notice"
    When using file system tools or other system-level access, always be careful about permissions. Limit the scope of what your agent can access, especially in production environments.

## Coming Soon

- Memory plugins for different storage backends

- Additional LLM providers

- Group agent coordination
