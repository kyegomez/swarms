## Getting Started

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.10
- `.env` file with your respective API keys (e.g., `PINECONE_API_KEY`)

### Installation

You can install the Swarms-Memory package using pip:

```bash
$ pip install swarms-memory
```

### Usage Examples

#### Pinecone

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Pinecone with Swarms-Memory:

1. **Import Required Libraries**:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from swarms_memory import PineconeMemory
```

2. **Define Custom Functions**:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Custom embedding function using a HuggingFace model
def custom_embedding_function(text: str) -> List[float]:
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().tolist()
    return embeddings

# Custom preprocessing function
def custom_preprocess(text: str) -> str:
    return text.lower().strip()

# Custom postprocessing function
def custom_postprocess(results: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    for result in results:
        result["custom_score"] = result["score"] * 2  # Example modification
    return results
```

3. **Initialize the Wrapper with Custom Functions**:

```python
wrapper = PineconeMemory(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    environment="your-environment",
    index_name="your-index-name",
    embedding_function=custom_embedding_function,
    preprocess_function=custom_preprocess,
    postprocess_function=custom_postprocess,
    logger_config={
        "handlers": [
            {"sink": "custom_rag_wrapper.log", "rotation": "1 GB"},
            {"sink": lambda msg: print(f"Custom log: {msg}", end="")},
        ],
    },
)
```

4. **Add Documents and Query**:

```python
# Adding documents
wrapper.add("This is a sample document about artificial intelligence.", {"category": "AI"})
wrapper.add("Python is a popular programming language for data science.", {"category": "Programming"})

# Querying
results = wrapper.query("What is AI?", filter={"category": "AI"})
for result in results:
    print(f"Score: {result['score']}, Custom Score: {result['custom_score']}, Text: {result['metadata']['text']}")
```

#### ChromaDB

Using ChromaDB with Swarms-Memory is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Import ChromaDB**:

```python
from swarms_memory import ChromaDB
```

2. **Initialize ChromaDB**:

```python
chromadb = ChromaDB(
    metric="cosine",
    output_dir="results",
    limit_tokens=1000,
    n_results=2,
    docs_folder="path/to/docs",
    verbose=True,
)
```

3. **Add and Query Documents**:

```python
# Add a document
doc_id = chromadb.add("This is a test document.")

# Query the document
result = chromadb.query("This is a test query.")

# Traverse a directory
chromadb.traverse_directory()

# Display the result
print(result)
```
