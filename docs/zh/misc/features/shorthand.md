# Shorthand Communication System
## Swarms Multi-Agent Framework

**The Enhanced Shorthand Communication System is designed to streamline agent-agent communication within the Swarms Multi-Agent Framework. This system employs concise alphanumeric notations to relay task-specific details to agents efficiently.**

---

## Format:

The shorthand format is structured as `[AgentType]-[TaskLayer].[TaskNumber]-[Priority]-[Status]`.

---

## Components:

### 1. Agent Type:
- Denotes the specific agent role, such as:
  * `C`: Code agent
  * `D`: Data processing agent
  * `M`: Monitoring agent
  * `N`: Network agent
  * `R`: Resource management agent
  * `I`: Interface agent
  * `S`: Security agent

### 2. Task Layer & Number:
- Represents the task's category.
  * Example: `1.8` signifies Task layer 1, task number 8.

### 3. Priority:
- Indicates task urgency.
  * `H`: High
  * `M`: Medium
  * `L`: Low

### 4. Status:
- Gives a snapshot of the task's progress.
  * `I`: Initialized
  * `P`: In-progress
  * `C`: Completed
  * `F`: Failed
  * `W`: Waiting

---

## Extended Features:

### 1. Error Codes (for failures): 
- `E01`: Resource issues
- `E02`: Data inconsistency
- `E03`: Dependency malfunction
... and more as needed.

### 2. Collaboration Flag: 
- `+`: Denotes required collaboration.

---

## Example Codes:

- `C-1.8-H-I`: A high-priority coding task that's initializing.
- `D-2.3-M-P`: A medium-priority data task currently in-progress.
- `M-3.5-L-P+`: A low-priority monitoring task in progress needing collaboration.

By leveraging the Enhanced Shorthand Communication System, the Swarms Multi-Agent Framework can ensure swift interactions, concise communications, and effective task management.
