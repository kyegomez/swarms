# Module/Function Name: BaseStructure

## Introduction:

The `BaseStructure` module contains the basic structure and attributes required for running machine learning models and associated metadata, error logging, artifact saving/loading, and relevant event logging. 

The module provides the flexibility to save and load the model metadata, log errors, save artifacts, and maintain a log for multiple events associated with multiple threads and batched operations. The key attributes of the module include **name**, **description**, **save_metadata_path**, and **save_error_path**.

metadata = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
base_structure.save_metadata(metadata)
```

### Example 2: Loading Artifact
```python
artifact_name = "example_artifact"
artifact_data = base_structure.load_artifact(artifact_name)
```

### Example 3: Running Concurrently
```python
concurrent_data = [data1, data2, data3]
results = base_structure.run_concurrent(batched_data=concurrent_data)
```
