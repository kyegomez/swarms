# Demo Ideas

* We could also try to create an AI influencer run by a swarm, let it create a whole identity and generate images, memes, and other content for Twitter, Reddit, etc.

* had a thought that we should have either a more general one of these or a swarm or both -- need something connecting all the calendars, events, and initiatives of all the AI communities, langchain, laion, eluther, lesswrong, gato, rob miles, chatgpt hackers, etc etc

* Swarm of AI influencers to spread marketing

* Delegation System to better organize teams: Start with a team of passionate humans and let them self-report their skills/strengths so the agent has a concept of who to delegate to, then feed the agent a huge task list (like the bullet list a few messages above) that it breaks down into actionable steps and "prompts" specific team members to complete tasks. Could even suggest breakout teams of a few people with complementary skills to tackle more complex tasks. There can also be a live board that updates each time a team member completes something, to encourage momentum and keep track of progress
