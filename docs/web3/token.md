## 📣 A Message from the Team

!!! quote
    When we launched $swarms, we prioritized community ownership by allocating just 2% to the team.  
    Our intent was radical decentralization. But that decision has created unintended consequences.

### ❗ Challenges We Faced

- **Market manipulation** by whales and exchanges  
- **Unsustainable funding** for innovation and ops  
- **Malicious actors undermining decentralization**

---

## 🛠 Our Proposed Solution

We are initiating a **DAO governance proposal** to:

=== "Key Reforms"

- 📈 **Increase team allocation to 10%**  
  Secure operational longevity and attract top contributors.

- 🌱 **Launch an ecosystem grants program**  
  Incentivize developers building agentic tools and infra.

- 🛡 **Combat token manipulation**  
  Deploy anti-whale policies and explore token lockups.

- 🤝 **Strengthen community dev initiatives**  
  Support contributor bounties, governance tooling, and hackathons.

> This proposal isn’t about centralizing power — it's about protecting and empowering the **Swarms ecosystem**.
