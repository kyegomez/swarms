### Example
-------

```python
agents = [agent1, agent2, agent3]
flow = "agent1 -> agent2, agent3"
task = "Perform a task"
rearrange(agents, flow, task)
```

### Example Usage
-------------

Here's an example of how to use the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function:

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange, rearrange
from typing import List

# Initialize the director agent
director = Agent(
    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the tasks for the workers",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="director.json",
)

# Initialize worker 1
worker1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker1",
    system_prompt="Generates a transcript for a youtube video on what swarms are",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker1.json",
)

# Initialize worker 2
worker2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker2",
    system_prompt="Summarizes the transcript generated by Worker1",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker2.json",
)

# Create a list of agents
agents = [director, worker1, worker2]

# Define the flow pattern
flow = "Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"

# Using AgentRearrange class
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)
output = agent_system.run("Create a format to express and communicate swarms of llms in a structured manner for youtube")
print(output)

# Using rearrange function
output = rearrange(agents, flow, "Create a format to express and communicate swarms of llms in a structured manner for youtube")
print(output)

```

In this example, we first initialize three agents: `director`, `worker1`, and `worker2`. Then, we create a list of these agents and define the flow pattern `"Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"`.

We can use the `AgentRearrange` class by creating an instance of it with the list of agents and the flow pattern. We then call the `run` method with the initial task, and it will execute the agents in the specified order, passing the output of one agent as the input to the next agent.

Alternatively, we can use the `rearrange` function by passing the list of agents, the flow pattern, and the initial task as arguments.

Both the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function will return the final output after processing the task through the agents according to the specified flow pattern.

## Error Handling
--------------

The `AgentRearrange` class includes error handling mechanisms to validate the flow pattern. If the flow pattern is incorrectly formatted or contains duplicate agent names, a `ValueError` will be raised with an appropriate error message.

### Example:

```python
# Invalid flow pattern
invalid_flow = "Director->Worker1,Worker2->Worker3"
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=invalid_flow)
output = agent_system.run("Some task")`
```

This will raise a `ValueError` with the message `"Agent 'Worker3' is not registered."`.


## Parallel and Sequential Processing
----------------------------------

The `AgentRearrange` class supports both parallel and sequential processing of tasks based on the specified flow pattern. If the flow pattern includes multiple agents separated by commas (e.g., `"agent1, agent2"`), the agents will be executed in parallel, and their outputs will be concatenated with a semicolon (`;`). If the flow pattern includes a single agent, it will be executed sequentially.


### Parallel processing
`parallel_flow = "Worker1, Worker2 -> Director"`

### Sequential processing
`sequential_flow = "Worker1 -> Worker2 -> Director"`

In the `parallel_flow` example, `Worker1` and `Worker2` will be executed in parallel, and their outputs will be concatenated and passed to `Director`. In the `sequential_flow` example, `Worker1` will be executed first, and its output will be passed to `Worker2`, and then the output of `Worker2` will be passed to `Director`.

## Logging
-------

The `AgentRearrange` class includes logging capabilities using the `loguru` library. If `verbose` is set to `True` during initialization, a log file named `agent_rearrange.log` will be created, and log messages will be written to it. You can use this log file to track the execution of the agents and any potential issues or errors that may occur.


```bash
2023-05-08 10:30:15.456 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Director to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.457 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Worker1 to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.457 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:__init__:34 - Adding agent Worker2 to the swarm.
2023-05-08 10:30:15.458 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:run:118 - Running agents in parallel: ['Worker1', 'Worker2']
2023-05-08 10:30:15.459 | INFO     | agent_rearrange:run:121 - Running agents sequentially: ['Director']`
```

## Additional Parameters
---------------------

The `AgentRearrange` class also accepts additional parameters that can be passed to the `run` method using `*args` and `**kwargs`. These parameters will be forwarded to the individual agents during execution.

`agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)`
`output = agent_system.run("Some task", max_tokens=200, temperature=0.7)`

In this example, the `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters will be passed to each agent during execution.

## Customization
-------------

The `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function can be customized and extended to suit specific use cases. For example, you can create custom agents by inheriting from the `Agent` class and implementing custom logic for task processing. You can then add these custom agents to the swarm and define the flow pattern accordingly.

Additionally, you can modify the `run` method of the `AgentRearrange` class to implement custom logic for task processing and agent interaction.


## Limitations
-----------

It's important to note that the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function rely on the individual agents to process tasks correctly. The quality of the output will depend on the capabilities and configurations of the agents used in the swarm. Additionally, the `AgentRearrange` class does not provide any mechanisms for task prioritization or load balancing among the agents.

## Future Improvements
-------------------

Here are some potential future improvements for the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function:

-   **Task Prioritization**: Implement a mechanism to prioritize tasks based on factors such as urgency, importance, or resource availability.
-   **Load Balancing**: Incorporate load balancing algorithms to distribute tasks among agents more efficiently, taking into account factors such as agent availability, performance, and resource utilization.
-   **Dynamic Flow Reconfiguration**: Allow for dynamic reconfiguration of the flow pattern during runtime, enabling the addition, removal, or reordering of agents based on specific conditions or events.
-   **Error Handling and Fault Tolerance**: Enhance error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms to gracefully handle agent failures, task timeouts, or other exceptional situations.
-   **Monitoring and Metrics**: Implement monitoring and metrics collection to track the performance and efficiency of the swarm, as well as individual agent performance.
-   **Scalability**: Enhance the scalability of the system to handle larger numbers of agents and tasks efficiently.

## Conclusion
----------

The `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function provide a flexible and extensible framework for orchestrating swarms of agents to process tasks based on a specified flow pattern. By combining the capabilities of individual agents, you can create complex workflows and leverage the strengths of different agents to tackle various tasks efficiently.

While the current implementation offers basic functionality for agent rearrangement, there is room for future improvements and customizations to enhance the system's capabilities and cater to more specific use cases.

Whether you're working on natural language processing tasks, data analysis, or any other domain where agent-based systems can be beneficial, the `AgentRearrange` class and the `rearrange` function provide a solid foundation for building and experimenting with swarm-based solutions.
