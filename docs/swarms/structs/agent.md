# `Agent` Documentation

Swarm Agent is a powerful autonomous agent framework designed to connect Language Models (LLMs) with various tools and long-term memory. This framework provides the ability to ingest and process various types of documents such as PDFs, text files, Markdown files, JSON files, and more. The Swarm Agent offers a wide range of features to enhance the capabilities of LLMs and facilitate efficient task execution.


The `Agent` class serves several key purposes:

1. **Conversational Loop**: It establishes a conversational loop with a language model. This means it allows you to interact with the model in a back-and-forth manner, taking turns in the conversation.

2. **Feedback Collection**: The class allows users to provide feedback on the responses generated by the model. This feedback can be valuable for training and improving the model's responses over time.

3. **Stoppable Conversation**: You can define custom stopping conditions for the conversation, allowing you to stop the interaction based on specific criteria. For example, you can stop the conversation if a certain keyword is detected in the responses.

4. **Retry Mechanism**: The class includes a retry mechanism that can be helpful if there are issues generating responses from the model. It attempts to generate a response multiple times before raising an error.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Swarm Agent, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install swarms`.
2. Import the necessary modules and classes from the `swarms` package.
3. Initialize an instance of the `Agent` class, providing the necessary configuration parameters such as the language model, system prompt, tools, and memory components.
4. Define the tasks you want the agent to perform and pass them to the `run()` method.
5. Optionally, customize the agent's behavior by adjusting parameters such as the maximum number of loops, stopping conditions, and tool integration.

Here's a basic example to illustrate the usage of the Swarm Agent:

```python
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Agent

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAIChat()

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3)

# Run a task
response = agent.run("Generate a report on the financial performance of a company.")
print(response)
```

This example initializes an instance of the `Agent` class with an OpenAI language model and a maximum of 3 loops. The `run()` method is then called with a task to generate a report on financial performance, and the agent's response is printed.

## Advanced Usage

The Swarm Agent provides numerous advanced features and customization options. Here are a few examples of how to leverage these features:

### Tool Integration

To integrate tools with the Swarm Agent, you can pass a list of callable functions to the `tools` parameter when initializing the `Agent` instance. The agent will automatically convert these functions into an OpenAI function calling schema and make them available for use during task execution.

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from my_tools import tool_function_1, tool_function_2

# Initialize the agent with tools
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3, tools=[tool_function_1, tool_function_2])
```

### Long-term Memory Management

The Swarm Agent supports integration with various vector databases for long-term memory management. You can pass an instance of a `BaseVectorDatabase` implementation to the `long_term_memory` parameter when initializing the `Agent`.

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from swarms.memory.chroma import ChromaVectorDatabase

# Initialize a vector database
vector_db = ChromaVectorDatabase(persist_directory="path/to/db")

# Initialize the agent with long-term memory
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3, long_term_memory=vector_db)
```

### Document Ingestion

The Swarm Agent can ingest various types of documents, such as PDFs, text files, Markdown files, and JSON files. You can pass a list of document paths or contents to the `docs` parameter when initializing the `Agent`.

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent

# Initialize the agent with documents
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3, docs=["path/to/doc1.pdf", "path/to/doc2.txt"])
```

### Interactive Mode

The Swarm Agent supports an interactive mode, where users can engage in real-time communication with the agent. To enable interactive mode, set the `interactive` parameter to `True` when initializing the `Agent`.

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent

# Initialize the agent in interactive mode
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3, interactive=True)

# Run the agent in interactive mode
agent.interactive_run()
```

### Sentiment Analysis

The Swarm Agent can perform sentiment analysis on its generated outputs using a sentiment analyzer function. You can pass a callable function to the `sentiment_analyzer` parameter when initializing the `Agent`.

```python
from swarms.structs import Agent
from my_sentiment_analyzer import sentiment_analyzer_function

# Initialize the agent with a sentiment analyzer
agent = Agent(llm=llm, max_loops=3, sentiment_analyzer=sentiment_analyzer_function)
```

## Documentation Examples

The Swarm Agent provides numerous examples and usage scenarios throughout the documentation. Here are a few examples to illustrate various features and functionalities:

### Undo Functionality

```python
# Feature 2: Undo functionality
response = agent.run("Another task")
print(f"Response: {response}")
previous_state, message = agent.undo_last()
print(message)
```

### Response Filtering

```python
# Feature 3: Response filtering
agent.add_response_filter("report")
response = agent.filtered_run("Generate a report on finance")
print(response)
```

### Saving and Loading State

```python
# Save the agent state
agent.save_state('saved_flow.json')

# Load the agent state
agent = Agent(llm=llm_instance, max_loops=5)
agent.load_state('saved_flow.json')
agent.run("Continue with the task")
```

### Async and Concurrent Execution

```python
# Run a task concurrently
response = await agent.run_concurrent("Concurrent task")
print(response)

# Run multiple tasks concurrently
tasks = [
    {"task": "Task 1"},
    {"task": "Task 2", "img": "path/to/image.jpg"},
    {"task": "Task 3", "custom_param": 42}
]
responses = agent.bulk_run(tasks)
print(responses)
```

These examples demonstrate just a few of the many features and capabilities offered by the Swarm Agent framework. For more detailed information and additional examples, please refer to the comprehensive documentation provided within the codebase.
