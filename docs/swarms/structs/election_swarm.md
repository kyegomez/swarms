# ElectionSwarm

The `ElectionSwarm` is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestrator selection system that implements AGENTSNET communication protocols for democratic decision-making. It enables agent voters to elect the best orchestrator candidate through various coordination algorithms, providing a structured approach to leadership selection in multi-agent workflows.

## Imports!

```python
from swarms.structs import ElectionSwarm
# or
from swarms.structs.election_swarm import ElectionSwarm
```

## Overview

The ElectionSwarm follows a democratic election workflow pattern:

1. **Task Reception**: User provides an election task to the swarm
2. **Voter Registration**: Agent voters are registered with their preferences and expertise
3. **Candidate Presentation**: Orchestrator candidates present their platforms and capabilities
4. **Message Passing**: Voters communicate with neighbors using AGENTSNET protocols
5. **Voting Process**: Voters cast structured votes with detailed reasoning
6. **Result Determination**: Election algorithms determine the winning orchestrator
7. **Context Preservation**: All conversation history and voting records are maintained

## Voter Tool Calls

The ElectionSwarm supports optional tool calls that allow voter agents to provide detailed explanations of their voting decisions. When enabled, each voter agent will make a tool call to `explain_voting_decision` before casting their vote.

### Tool Call Features

- **Detailed Explanations**: Voters provide comprehensive reasoning for their choices
- **Structured Data**: Tool calls include voter name, ID, chosen candidate, and reasoning
- **Confidence Levels**: Voters specify their confidence in their decision
- **Alternative Considerations**: Voters explain why other candidates were not chosen
- **Key Factors**: Voters list the most important factors influencing their decision

### Tool Call Structure

```python
{
    "voter_name": "Alice Johnson",
    "voter_id": "voter_001", 
    "chosen_candidate": "John Progressive",
    "voting_reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this candidate was chosen",
    "key_factors": ["healthcare policy", "environmental stance", "experience"],
    "confidence_level": 0.85,
    "alternative_considerations": "Considered Sarah Conservative but disagreed on healthcare"
}
```

### Enabling Tool Calls

```python
# Enable voter tool calls in configuration
config = ElectionConfig(
    config_data={
        "enable_voter_tool_calls": True,
        # ... other config options
    }
)

election = ElectionSwarm(
    election_config=config,
    # ... other parameters
)
```

## AGENTSNET Communication Protocols

### Message Passing Protocol

The ElectionSwarm implements AGENTSNET-inspired message-passing for distributed coordination:

- **Synchronous Communication**: Agents communicate in discrete rounds
- **Neighbor-Only Messaging**: Agents can only communicate with immediate neighbors
- **JSON Message Format**: Structured message exchange
- **Multi-Round Process**: Multiple rounds for information propagation
- **Final Decision**: Agents make final decisions after communication rounds

### Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant V1 as Voter 1
    participant V2 as Voter 2
    participant V3 as Voter 3
    participant ES as ElectionSwarm

    Note over ES: Round 1: Initial Communication
    V1->>V2: Share candidate preferences
    V2->>V1: Share candidate preferences
    V2->>V3: Share candidate preferences
    V3->>V2: Share candidate preferences

    Note over ES: Round 2: Information Exchange
    V1->>V2: Discuss reasoning factors
    V2->>V1: Discuss reasoning factors
    V2->>V3: Discuss reasoning factors
    V3->>V2: Discuss reasoning factors

    Note over ES: Round 3: Final Consensus
    V1->>ES: Final vote with reasoning
    V2->>ES: Final vote with reasoning
    V3->>ES: Final vote with reasoning
```

## Election Algorithms

The ElectionSwarm implements five AGENTSNET-inspired algorithms for orchestrator selection. Each algorithm is designed for different coordination scenarios and communication patterns.

### 1. Consensus Algorithm

All agents must agree on a single orchestrator candidate through multiple rounds of communication.

- **Purpose**: Achieve unanimous agreement on orchestrator selection
- **Process**: Multiple rounds until consensus threshold is reached
- **Threshold**: Configurable consensus threshold (default: 60%)
- **Fallback**: Majority vote if consensus not reached
- **Implementation**: `_conduct_consensus_election()` method
- **Use Case**: When unanimous agreement is required

### 2. Leader Election Algorithm

Select a single leader orchestrator through distributed voting.

- **Purpose**: Elect one orchestrator to lead the multi-agent workflow
- **Process**: Direct voting with winner-takes-all mechanism
- **Complexity**: O(D) rounds where D is network diameter
- **Implementation**: `_conduct_leader_election()` method
- **Use Case**: When clear leadership hierarchy is needed

### 3. Matching Algorithm

Pair voters with compatible orchestrator candidates using maximal matching.

- **Purpose**: Create optimal voter-candidate pairings
- **Process**: Maximal matching to avoid conflicts
- **Complexity**: O(log* n) rounds
- **Implementation**: `_conduct_matching_election()` method
- **Use Case**: When specialized orchestrator-voter relationships are important

### 4. Coloring Algorithm

Group voters and candidates into compatible categories using graph coloring.

- **Purpose**: Assign roles such that neighbors have different roles
- **Process**: (Δ+1)-coloring where Δ is maximum node degree
- **Complexity**: O(log* n) rounds
- **Implementation**: `_conduct_coloring_election()` method
- **Use Case**: Role assignment with conflict avoidance

### 5. Vertex Cover Algorithm

Select minimal set of coordinator agents to cover all voters.

- **Purpose**: Choose minimal set of orchestrators to cover all voters
- **Process**: Minimal vertex cover selection
- **Complexity**: O(log* n) rounds
- **Implementation**: `_conduct_vertex_cover_election()` method
- **Use Case**: When resource-efficient coordination is needed

### Algorithm Selection

Choose the appropriate algorithm based on your coordination needs:

```python
# For unanimous decisions
ElectionAlgorithm.CONSENSUS

# For clear leadership
ElectionAlgorithm.LEADER_ELECTION

# For optimal pairings
ElectionAlgorithm.MATCHING

# For role assignment
ElectionAlgorithm.COLORING

# For minimal coordination
ElectionAlgorithm.VERTEX_COVER
```

# - Cache
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Voter Design

- **Diverse Expertise**: Include voters with different specializations
- **Balanced Preferences**: Ensure varied preference profiles
- **Neighbor Connections**: Create meaningful neighbor relationships
- **Realistic Demographics**: Use realistic agent characteristics

### 2. Candidate Design

- **Clear Platforms**: Define distinct policy positions
- **Compelling Promises**: Create realistic campaign promises
- **Relevant Experience**: Include pertinent background experience
- **Leadership Styles**: Vary leadership and coordination approaches

### 3. Election Configuration

- **Appropriate Algorithms**: Choose algorithms matching your use case
- **Budget Management**: Set realistic budget limits
- **Caching Strategy**: Enable caching for repeated elections
- **Logging Level**: Use verbose logging for debugging

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Enable lazy loading for large swarms
- **Batch Processing**: Use appropriate batch sizes
- **Parallel Execution**: Leverage concurrent operations
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track and optimize token usage

## Error Handling

The ElectionSwarm includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    result = election.run(
        task="Select orchestrator",
        election_type=ElectionAlgorithm.CONSENSUS
    )
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Election failed: {e}")
```

Common error scenarios:

- **No voters or candidates**: Ensure at least one participant
- **Invalid algorithm**: Use supported ElectionAlgorithm values
- **Budget exceeded**: Monitor and adjust budget limits
- **Agent loading failures**: Check agent configurations

## Integration with Other Swarms

The ElectionSwarm can be integrated with other Swarms architectures:

```python
# Use with BoardOfDirectorsSwarm
from swarms.structs.board_of_directors_swarm import BoardOfDirectorsSwarm

# Create board election
board_election = ElectionSwarm(
    name="Board CEO Election",
    voters=board_members,
    candidates=ceo_candidates
)

# Elect CEO
ceo_result = board_election.run(
    task="Elect CEO for board governance",
    election_type=ElectionAlgorithm.CONSENSUS
)

# Use elected CEO with BoardOfDirectorsSwarm
board = BoardOfDirectorsSwarm(
    chairman=ceo_result.winner,
    # ... other board configuration
)
```

## Utility Functions
