# Create specialized swarms for different corporate functions
finance_swarm = SwarmRouter(
    name="finance-swarm",
    description="Handles financial decisions and analysis",
    agents=[corporation.members[member_id].agent for member_id in finance_members],
    swarm_type="SequentialWorkflow"
)

# Integrate with hierarchical swarm
hierarchical_swarm = HybridHierarchicalClusterSwarm(
    name="Corporate Hierarchical Swarm",
    swarms=[finance_swarm, operations_swarm, marketing_swarm],
    max_loops=2
)
```

## Performance Considerations
