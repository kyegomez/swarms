## Quick Start

All model providers follow a consistent pattern in Swarms. Here's the basic template:

```python
from swarms import Agent
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Initialize agent with your chosen model
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Your-Agent-Name",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Varies by provider
    system_prompt="Your system prompt here",
    agent_description="Description of what your agent does.",
)

# Run your agent
response = agent.run("Your query here")
```

## Environment Setup

Most providers require API keys. Add them to your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Groq
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

# Cohere
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key

# DeepSeek
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key

# OpenRouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key

# XAI
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_key

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
AZURE_API_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
```

!!! note "No API Key Required"
    Ollama and vLLM can be run locally without API keys, making them perfect for development and testing.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Model Workflows

Swarms allows you to create workflows that use different models for different tasks:

```python
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow

# Research agent using Claude for analysis
research_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Research-Agent",
    model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    system_prompt="You are a research expert."
)

# Creative agent using GPT-4o for content generation
creative_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Creative-Agent", 
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt="You are a creative content expert."
)

# Workflow combining both agents
workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    name="Research-Creative-Workflow",
    agents=[research_agent, creative_agent]
)
```

### Model Routing

Automatically route tasks to the most appropriate model:

```python
from swarms import Agent, ModelRouter

# Define model preferences for different task types
model_router = ModelRouter(
    models={
        "analysis": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        "creative": "gpt-4o", 
        "fast": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "local": "ollama/llama2"
    }
)

# Agent will automatically choose the best model
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Smart-Agent",
    llm=model_router,
    system_prompt="You are a versatile assistant."
)
```
