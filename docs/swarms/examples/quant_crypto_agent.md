# Quant Crypto Agent

- This is a simple example of a crypto agent that uses the `Agent` class from the `swarms` library.
- It uses the `fetch_htx_data` and `coin_gecko_coin_api` tools to fetch data from the `htx` and `CoinGecko` APIs.
- It uses the `Agent` class to create an agent that can analyze the current state of a crypto asset.

## Steps

1. Install the `swarms` library.
2. Install the `swarms_tools` library.
3. Setup your `.env` file with the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables.
4. Run the code.

## Installation:

```bash
pip install swarms swarms-tools python-dotenv
```

## Code:

```python
from swarms import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms_tools import fetch_htx_data, coin_gecko_coin_api

load_dotenv()
