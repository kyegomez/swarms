     - **Context Retention:** Agents that depend on historical context to make decisions or carry out tasks can store and access memory using this folder.
     - **Long-Term and Short-Term Memory:** This could be implemented in various ways, such as short-term conversational memory or long-term knowledge storage.
   - **Importance:** Crucial for agents that require memory to handle complex workflows, where decisions are based on prior outputs or interactions.

---

### **5. Models Folder (`models/`) Moved to `swarm_models`**
   - **Role:** 
     - The **models** folder houses pre-trained machine learning models that agents utilize to complete their tasks. These models could include LLMs (Large Language Models), custom-trained models, or fine-tuned models specific to the tasks being handled by the agents.
     - **Plug-and-Play Architecture:** The framework allows users to easily add or switch models depending on the specific needs of their agents.
     - **Custom Model Support:** Users can integrate custom models here for more specialized tasks.
   - **Importance:** Provides the computational backbone for agent decision-making and task execution.

---

### **6. Prompts Folder (`prompts/`)**
   - **Role:** 
     - The **prompts** folder contains reusable prompt templates that agents use to interact with their environment and complete tasks. These system prompts define the behavior and task orientation of the agents.
     - **Template Reusability:** Users can create and store common prompt templates, making it easy to define agent behavior across different tasks without rewriting prompts from scratch.
     - **Task-Specific Prompts:** For example, an accounting agent may have a prompt template that guides its interaction with financial data.
   - **Importance:** Provides the logic and guidance agents need to generate outputs in a coherent and task-focused manner.

---

### **7. Schemas Folder (`schemas/`)**
   - **Role:** 
     - The **schemas** folder defines the data structures and validation logic for inputs and outputs within the framework, using tools like **Pydantic** for data validation.
     - **Standardization and Validation:** This ensures that all interactions between agents and swarms follow consistent data formats, which is critical for large-scale agent coordination and task management.
     - **Error Prevention:** By validating data early, it prevents errors from propagating through the system, improving reliability.
   - **Importance:** Ensures data consistency across the entire framework, making it easier to integrate and manage swarms of agents at scale.

---

### **8. Structs Folder (`structs/`)**
   - **Role:** 
     - The **structs** folder is the core of the Swarms framework, housing the orchestration logic for managing and coordinating swarms of agents. This folder allows for dynamic task assignment, queue management, inter-agent communication, and result aggregation.
