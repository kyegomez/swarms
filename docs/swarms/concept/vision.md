### Code Examples

#### 1. Basic Financial Analysis Agent:
This example demonstrates a simple financial agent setup that responds to financial questions, such as establishing a ROTH IRA, using OpenAI's GPT-based model.

```python
import os
from swarms import Agent
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import (
    FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
)
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get OpenAI API key from environment
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Initialize OpenAIChat model with desired parameters
model = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key, model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.1
)

# Initialize the Financial Analysis Agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    llm=model,
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True,
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",
    user_name="swarms_corp",
    retry_attempts=1,
    context_length=200000,
    return_step_meta=False,
)

# Example task for the agent
out = agent.run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria?"
)

# Output the agent's result
print(out)
```

#### 2. Agent Orchestration with AgentRearrange:
The following example showcases how to use the `AgentRearrange` class to manage a multi-agent system. It sets up a director agent to orchestrate two workers—one to generate a transcript and another to summarize it.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange
from swarm_models import Anthropic

# Initialize the Director agent
director = Agent(
    agent_name="Director",
    system_prompt="Directs the tasks for the workers",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="director.json",
)

# Initialize Worker 1 agent (transcript generation)
worker1 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker1",
    system_prompt="Generates a transcript for a YouTube video on what swarms are",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker1.json",
)

# Initialize Worker 2 agent (summarizes transcript)
worker2 = Agent(
    agent_name="Worker2",
    system_prompt="Summarizes the transcript generated by Worker1",
    llm=Anthropic(),
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    stopping_token="<DONE>",
    state_save_file_type="json",
    saved_state_path="worker2.json",
)

# Create a list of agents
agents = [director, worker1, worker2]

# Define the workflow pattern (sequential flow)
flow = "Director -> Worker1 -> Worker2"

# Using AgentRearrange to orchestrate the agents
agent_system = AgentRearrange(agents=agents, flow=flow)

# Running the system with a sample task
output = agent_system.run(
    "Create a format to express and communicate swarms of LLMs in a structured manner for YouTube"
)

# Output the result
print(output)
```

#### 1. Basic Agent Flow:
Here’s a visual representation of the basic workflow using Mermaid to display the sequential flow between agents.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Director] --> B[Worker 1: Generate Transcript]
    B --> C[Worker 2: Summarize Transcript]
```

In this diagram:
- The **Director** agent assigns tasks.
- **Worker 1** generates a transcript for a YouTube video.
- **Worker 2** summarizes the transcript.

#### 2. Sequential Agent Flow:
This diagram showcases a sequential agent setup where one agent completes its task before the next agent starts its task.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Director] --> B[Worker 1: Generate Transcript]
    B --> C[Worker 2: Summarize Transcript]
    C --> D[Worker 3: Finalize]
```

In this setup:
- The **Director** agent assigns tasks to **Worker 1**, which generates a transcript for a YouTube video.
- **Worker 1** completes its task before **Worker 2** starts summarizing the transcript.
- **Worker 2** completes its task before **Worker 3** finalizes the process.

### Why Developers Should Choose Swarms:

Swarms is designed with flexibility at its core. Developers can create custom architectures and workflows, enabling extreme control over how agents interact with each other. Whether it’s a linear process or a complex mesh of agent communications, Swarms handles it efficiently.

With support for extreme third-party integration, Swarms makes it easy for developers to plug into external systems, such as APIs or internal databases. This allows agents to act on live data, process external inputs, and execute actions in real time, making it a powerful tool for real-world applications.

Swarms abstracts the complexity of managing multiple agents with orchestration tools like `AgentRearrange`. Developers can define workflows that execute tasks concurrently or sequentially, depending on the problem at hand. This makes it easy to build and maintain large-scale automation systems.

### Conclusion:
Swarms is not just another multi-agent framework; it's built specifically for developers who need powerful tools to automate complex, large-scale business operations. With flexible architecture, deep integration capabilities, and developer-friendly APIs, Swarms is the ultimate solution for businesses looking to streamline operations and future-proof their workflows.
