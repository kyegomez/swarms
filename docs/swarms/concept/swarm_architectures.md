# Multi-Agent Architectures

### What is a Multi-Agent Architecture?

A multi-agent architecture refers to a group of more than two agents working collaboratively to achieve a common goal. These agents can be software entities, such as LLMs that interact with each other to perform complex tasks. The concept of multi-agent architectures is inspired by how humans communicate and work together in teams, organizations, and communities, where individual contributions combine to create sophisticated collaborative problem-solving capabilities.

### How Multi-Agent Architectures Facilitate Communication

Multi-agent architectures are designed to establish and manage communication between agents within a system. These architectures define how agents interact, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Here are some key aspects of multi-agent architectures:

1. **Hierarchical Communication**: In hierarchical architectures, communication flows from higher-level agents to lower-level agents. Higher-level agents act as coordinators, distributing tasks and aggregating results. This structure is efficient for tasks that require top-down control and decision-making.

2. **Concurrent Communication**: In concurrent architectures, agents operate independently and simultaneously on different tasks. This architecture is suitable for tasks that can be processed concurrently without dependencies, allowing for faster execution and scalability.

3. **Sequential Communication**: Sequential architectures process tasks in a linear order, where each agent's output becomes the input for the next agent. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled in the correct sequence, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.

4. **Mesh Communication**: In mesh architectures, agents are fully connected, allowing any agent to communicate with any other agent. This setup provides high flexibility and redundancy, making it ideal for complex systems requiring dynamic interactions.

5. **Federated Communication**: Federated architectures involve multiple independent systems that collaborate by sharing information and results. Each system operates autonomously but can contribute to a larger task, enabling distributed problem-solving across different nodes.

Multi-agent architectures leverage these communication patterns to ensure that agents work together efficiently, adapting to the specific requirements of the task at hand. By defining clear communication protocols and interaction models, multi-agent architectures enable the seamless orchestration of multiple agents, leading to enhanced performance and problem-solving capabilities.

## Architectural Patterns

### Hierarchical Architecture

**Overview:**
Organizes agents in a tree-like structure. Higher-level agents delegate tasks to lower-level agents, which can further divide tasks among themselves. This structure allows for efficient task distribution and scalability.

**Use Cases:**

- Complex decision-making processes where tasks can be broken down into subtasks

- Multi-stage workflows such as data processing pipelines or hierarchical reinforcement learning

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Agent] --> B1[Sub-Agent 1]
    A --> B2[Sub-Agent 2]
    B1 --> C1[Sub-Agent 1.1]
    B1 --> C2[Sub-Agent 1.2]
    B2 --> C3[Sub-Agent 2.1]
    B2 --> C4[Sub-Agent 2.2]
```

---

### Agent Rearrange

**Overview:**
A dynamic architecture where agents rearrange themselves based on task requirements and environmental conditions. Agents can adapt their roles, positions, and relationships to optimize performance for different scenarios.

**Use Cases:**
- Adaptive manufacturing lines that reconfigure based on product requirements

- Dynamic sales territory realignment based on market conditions

- Flexible healthcare staffing that adjusts to patient needs

graph TD
    A[Task Requirements] --> B[Configuration Analyzer]
    B --> C[Optimization Engine]
    
    C --> D[Agent Pool]
    D --> E[Agent 1]
    D --> F[Agent 2]
    D --> G[Agent 3]
    D --> H[Agent N]
    
    C --> I[Rearrangement Logic]
    I --> J[New Configuration]
    J --> K[Role Assignment]
    K --> L[Execution Phase]
    
    L --> M[Performance Monitor]
    M --> N{Optimization Needed?}
    N -->|Yes| C
    N -->|No| O[Continue Execution]
```

---

### Concurrent Architecture

**Overview:**
Multiple agents operate independently and simultaneously on different tasks. Each agent works on its own task without dependencies on the others.

**Use Cases:**
- Tasks that can be processed independently, such as parallel data analysis

- Large-scale simulations where multiple scenarios are run simultaneously


**[Learn More](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/concurrentworkflow/)**

```mermaid

    B1 --> C1[Output 1]
    B2 --> C2[Output 2]
    B3 --> C3[Output 3]
    B4 --> C4[Output 4]
```

---

### Sequential Architecture

**Overview:**
Processes tasks in a linear sequence. Each agent completes its task before passing the result to the next agent in the chain. Ensures orderly processing and is useful when tasks have dependencies.

**Use Cases:**

- Workflows where each step depends on the previous one, such as assembly lines or sequential data processing

- Scenarios requiring strict order of operations

    B --> C[Agent 2]
    C --> D[Agent 3]
    D --> E[Agent 4]
    E --> F[Final Output]
```

---

### Round Robin Architecture

**Overview:**
Tasks are distributed cyclically among a set of agents. Each agent takes turns handling tasks in a rotating order, ensuring even distribution of workload.

**Use Cases:**

- Load balancing in distributed systems

- Scenarios requiring fair distribution of tasks to avoid overloading any single agent

    B2 --> C
    B3 --> C
    B4 --> C
    C --> A
```
