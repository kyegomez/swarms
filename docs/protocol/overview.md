# Swarms Protocol Overview & Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Swarms protocol architecture, illustrating the flow from agent classes to multi-agent structures, and showcasing the main components and folders within the `swarms/` package. The Swarms framework is designed for extensibility, modularity, and production-readiness, enabling the orchestration of intelligent agents, tools, memory, and complex multi-agent systems.

---

## Introduction

Swarms is an enterprise-grade, production-ready multi-agent orchestration framework. It enables developers and organizations to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents that can reason, collaborate, and solve complex tasks autonomously or in groups. The architecture is inspired by the principles of modularity, composability, and scalability, ensuring that each component can be extended or replaced as needed.

The protocol is structured to support a wide range of use cases, from simple single-agent automations to sophisticated multi-agent workflows involving memory, tool use, and advanced reasoning.

For a high-level introduction and installation instructions, see the [Swarms Docs Home](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/).

## High-Level Architecture Flow

The Swarms protocol is organized into several key layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system. The typical flow is as follows:

1. **Agent Class (`swarms/agents`)**
    
    - The core building block of the framework. Agents encapsulate logic, state, and behavior. They can be simple (stateless) or complex 
    (stateful, with memory and reasoning capabilities).
    
    - Agents can be specialized for different tasks (e.g., reasoning agents, tool agents, judge agents, etc.).
    
    - Example: A `ReasoningAgent` that can analyze data and make decisions, or a `ToolAgent` that wraps external APIs.
    
    - [Quickstart for Agents](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/agents/)
    
    - [Agent API Reference](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent/)

2. **Tools with Memory (`swarms/tools`, `swarms/utils`)**
    - Tools are modular components that agents use to interact with the outside world, perform computations, or access resources (APIs, 
    databases, files, etc.).

    - Memory modules and utility functions allow agents to retain context, cache results, and manage state across interactions.
    
    - Example: A tool for calling an LLM API, a memory cache for conversation history, or a utility for parsing and formatting data.
    
    - [Tools Overview](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms_tools/overview/)
    
    - [BaseTool Reference](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/tools/base_tool/)

3. **Reasoning & Specialized Agents (`swarms/agents`)**
    - These agents build on the base agent class, adding advanced reasoning, self-consistency, and specialized logic for tasks like 
    planning, evaluation, or multi-step workflows.

    - Includes agents for self-reflection, iterative improvement, and domain-specific expertise.

    - Example: A `SelfConsistencyAgent` that aggregates multiple reasoning paths, or a `JudgeAgent` that evaluates outputs from other 
    agents.

    - [Reasoning Agents Overview](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/agents/reasoning_agents_overview/)
    
    - [Self Consistency Agent](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/agents/consistency_agent/)
    
    - [Agent Judge](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/agents/agent_judge/)

4. **Multi-Agent Structures (`swarms/structs`)**
    - Agents are composed into higher-order structures for collaboration, voting, parallelism, and workflow orchestration.

    - Includes swarms for majority voting, round-robin execution, hierarchical delegation, and more.

    - Example: A `MajorityVotingSwarm` that aggregates outputs from several agents, or a `HierarchicalSwarm` that delegates tasks to 
    sub-agents.

    - [MajorityVotingSwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/majorityvoting/)
    
    - [HierarchicalSwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/hierarchical_swarm/)
    
    - [Sequential Workflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)
    
    - [Concurrent Workflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/concurrentworkflow/)

5. **Supporting Components**

    - **Communication (`swarms/communication`)**: Provides wrappers for inter-agent communication, database access, message passing, and 
    integration with external systems (e.g., Redis, DuckDB, Pulsar). See [Communication Structure](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/conversation/)
    
    - **Artifacts (`swarms/artifacts`)**: Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of artifacts (outputs, files, logs) generated by 
    agents and swarms.
    
    - **Prompts (`swarms/prompts`)**: Houses prompt templates, system prompts, and agent-specific prompts for LLM-based agents. See 
    [Prompts Management](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/tree/master/swarms/prompts/)
    
    - **Telemetry (`swarms/telemetry`)**: Handles logging, monitoring, and bootup routines for observability and debugging.
    
    - **Schemas (`swarms/schemas`)**: Defines data schemas for agents, tools, completions, and communication protocols, ensuring type 
    safety and consistency.
    
    - **CLI (`swarms/cli`)**: Provides command-line utilities for agent creation, management, and orchestration. See [CLI Documentation]
    (https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/cli/cli_reference/)

## Proposing Large Improvements or Enhancements: Swarms Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

For significant changes, new agent architectures, or radical new features, Swarms uses a formal process called **Swarms Improvement Proposals (SIPs)**. SIPs are design documents that describe new features, enhancements, or changes to the Swarms framework. They ensure that major changes are well-documented, discussed, and reviewed by the community before implementation.

**When to use a SIP:**

- Proposing new agent types, swarm patterns, or coordination mechanisms

- Core framework changes or breaking changes

- New integrations (LLM providers, tools, external services)

- Any complex or multi-component feature

**SIP Process Overview:**

1. Discuss your idea in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/discussions)

2. Submit a SIP as a GitHub Issue using the SIP template

3. Engage with the community and iterate on your proposal

4. Undergo review and, if accepted, proceed to implementation

**Learn more:** See the full [SIP Guidelines and Template](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/protocol/sip/)

## How the System Works Together

The Swarms protocol is designed for composability. Agents can be created and configured independently, then composed into larger structures (swarms) for collaborative or competitive workflows. Tools and memory modules are injected into agents as needed, enabling them to perform complex tasks and retain context. Multi-agent structures orchestrate the flow of information and decision-making, while supporting components (communication, telemetry, artifacts, etc.) ensure robustness, observability, and extensibility.

For example, a typical workflow might involve:

- Creating a set of specialized agents (e.g., data analyst, summarizer, judge).

- Registering tools (e.g., LLM API, database access, web search) and memory modules.

- Composing agents into a `MajorityVotingSwarm` for collaborative decision-making.

- Using communication wrappers to exchange data between agents and external systems.

- Logging all actions and outputs for traceability and debugging.


For more advanced examples, see the [Examples Overview](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/examples/).

## Swarms Framework Philosophy

Swarms is built on the following principles:

- **Modularity:** Every component (agent, tool, prompt, schema) is a module that can be extended or replaced.

- **Composability:** Agents and tools can be composed into larger structures for complex workflows.

- **Observability:** Telemetry and artifact management ensure that all actions are traceable and debuggable.

- **Extensibility:** New agents, tools, and workflows can be added with minimal friction.

- **Production-Readiness:** The framework is designed for reliability, scalability, and real-world deployment.


For more on the philosophy and architecture, see [Development Philosophy & Principles](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/concept/philosophy/) and [Understanding Swarms Architecture](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/concept/framework_architecture/).
