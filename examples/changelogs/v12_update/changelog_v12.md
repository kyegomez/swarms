## Features

### Persistent Memory (`persistent_memory`)

**2026-05-02** · `e48100a9` · Kye Gomez

Added `persistent_memory: bool = True` to `Agent`. When `True` (default) the agent reads and writes a `MEMORY.md` file under `$WORKSPACE_DIR/agents/{agent_name}/MEMORY.md`, loading prior conversation history as a system preamble on every startup so state survives process restarts. Set to `False` for a fully stateless agent — no disk reads or writes, every run starts from a blank slate.

```python
# Stateless — no cross-session carry-over
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="MyAgent",
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    persistent_memory=False,
)
```

---

### Grep Tool for Autonomous Loop

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

Added a `grep` tool to the autonomous loop tool set. The agent can now search for patterns in files without falling back to `run_bash`. Arguments are passed as an argv list (no `shell=True`) to prevent injection. Output is capped at 64 KB.

Parameters: `pattern` (required), `path`, `recursive`, `case_insensitive`, `include_line_numbers`, `file_pattern`, `context_lines`.

```python
agent = Agent(agent_name="Coder", model_name="gpt-4.1", max_loops="auto")
agent.run("Find all TODO comments in the src/ directory")
```

---

### Persistent Conversation Memory on Disk

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

`Conversation` now persists every message to a `MEMORY.md` file and reloads it as a system preamble on the next instantiation. The file path is keyed on `agent_name` (not the ephemeral `id`) so memory is stable across process restarts.

---

### Context Compressor — Auto-Summarise at Token Threshold

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

Added `ContextCompressor`, activated at the top of every loop iteration when token usage crosses 90 % of `context_length`. It summarises and rewrites `MEMORY.md` in place to keep the context window healthy during long sessions. Controlled via `context_compression: bool = True` on `Agent`.

---

### Conversation Compact with Archive Snapshots

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

`Conversation.compact()` creates a timestamped archive snapshot before rewriting the active `MEMORY.md`, so the full history is recoverable even after compression.

---

### Interactive Mode — Graceful Exit on Keyboard Interrupt

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

`Ctrl+C` in interactive mode now exits cleanly instead of raising an unhandled `KeyboardInterrupt`.

---

### Interactive Mode — Rich Loading Spinner

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

Added a Rich animated spinner displayed while the agent processes a task in interactive mode.

---

### GraphWorkflow — `on_node_complete` and `streaming_callback`

**2026-05-01 (merged)** · `f09e753f` · Steve-Dusty

`GraphWorkflow.run()` now accepts an `on_node_complete` callback that fires after each node completes, and a `streaming_callback` that forwards individual response tokens in real time.

```python
def on_node_complete(node_name: str, result: str) -> None:
    print(f"[{node_name}] done")

workflow.run(task="Analyse this dataset", on_node_complete=on_node_complete)
```

---

## Bug Fixes

### Multi-Provider — Non-OpenAI Providers Producing No Output

**2026-04-23** · `9d250edf` · Steve-Dusty

Fixed a regression where providers other than OpenAI (Anthropic, Google, etc.) returned an empty string instead of their response content when `reasoning_effort` was set.

---

### Streaming — Thinking Panel Corruption Inside Rich Live Context

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

`console.print()` called from inside a generator consumed by a `rich.Live` block caused terminal corruption (overlapping panels, cursor misplacement). Fixed by pre-draining thinking chunks and printing the thinking panel *before* the `Live` context opens.

---

### Autonomous Loop — `_generate_final_summary` Dropped `streaming_callback`

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

`_generate_final_summary` was not forwarding `streaming_callback` to `call_llm`, so the summary phase streamed silently even when a callback was registered. Fixed by threading `streaming_callback` through the method signature.

---

### License Metadata — Corrected MIT → Apache 2.0

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

`pyproject.toml` declared `license = "MIT"` and the corresponding OSI classifier, conflicting with the actual Apache 2.0 `LICENSE` file. Both fields corrected to `Apache-2.0`.

---

## Improvements

### Autonomous Loop — Execution Prompt Written Once Per Subtask

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

The execution prompt was added to `short_memory` on every inner-loop iteration, causing the model to see duplicate context and treat subsequent iterations as repeated work. Moved the `short_memory.add` call to outside the inner while loop so it fires exactly once per subtask.

---

### Autonomous Loop — Exclude `think` Tool When Native Thinking Is Enabled

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

When `thinking_tokens` is set the model already reasons via extended thinking. The `think` tool created unnecessary extra round-trips. It is now filtered from `planning_tools` when `thinking_tokens is not None`.

---

### `arun_stream` — Use `get_running_loop` and Propagate Exceptions

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

`arun_stream()` used the deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` and silently swallowed exceptions from the background thread. Fixed to use `asyncio.get_running_loop()` and propagate exceptions to the async consumer.

---

### Performance — Guard `any_to_str()` with `isinstance` Check

**2026-04-20** · `4824fe82` · adichaudhary

Added an `isinstance` short-circuit before calling `any_to_str()` in `AgentRearrange`, avoiding an unnecessary conversion when the value is already a string.

---

### Remove `uvloop` / `winloop` Dependencies

**2026-04-19** · `9879c4f1` · Kye Gomez / Steve-Dusty / MycCellium420

Removed `uvloop` and `winloop` from the dependency list and deleted the dead execution functions that depended on them. Reduces install size and eliminates a platform-specific dependency that was never activated in production.

---

### Timestamps in Conversation History String

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

`Conversation.return_history_as_string()` now includes ISO timestamps on each message entry, making exported history easier to audit and correlate with logs.

---

### Senator Assembly Module Removed

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

Deleted the deprecated `swarms/sims/senator_assembly.py` (3 483 lines) and its associated example and `__init__` re-export.

---

## Tests

### Conversation — MEMORY.md Persistence, Compact, and Timestamp Coverage

**2026-04-23** · `fbc8a2bd` · Steve-Dusty

Added a dedicated test suite covering MEMORY.md round-trip persistence, compact-with-archive behaviour, and timestamp formatting in `return_history_as_string`.

---

### Agent Streaming and Autonomous Loop — Real-LLM Test Suite

**2026-05-02** · `75e12876` · Kye Gomez

Added `test_agent_streaming_and_loop.py` — 71 tests across 19 classes using real `Agent` and `LiteLLM` instances (no mocked LLM). Covers streaming pipeline correctness, `arun_stream` async behaviour, thinking-panel rendering, autonomous loop harness fixes, and `_generate_final_summary` callback threading.

---

## Docs

### Agent Memory Guide

**2026-04-20** · `9205bd16` · Kye Gomez

New guide at `docs/swarms/agents/agent_memory.md` covering the full MEMORY.md flow, `ContextCompressor` activation, and compact-with-archive behaviour.

---

### Agent Docs — Persistent Memory and Context Compression Examples

**2026-05-02** · `e48100a9` · Kye Gomez

Added a "Memory Persistence and Context Compression" section to `docs/swarms/structs/agent.md` with annotated code examples for `persistent_memory`, `context_compression`, and combined usage patterns.

---

### GraphWorkflow Streaming Callback Example

**2026-05-01** · `80824067` · Steve-Dusty

Added a complete runnable example demonstrating `on_node_complete` and `streaming_callback` usage with `GraphWorkflow`.

---

### README Updates

**2026-04-30** · Kye Gomez

Multiple README passes: updated import paths for `SwarmRouter`, `AutoSwarmBuilder`, and `AOP` to use the top-level `swarms` package; updated model name references and integration examples.
