This directory contains examples demonstrating Mixture of Agents patterns.

## Examples

- [mixture_of_agents_example.py](mixture_of_agents_example.py) - Mixture of agents implementation
- [test_moa_new.py](test_moa_new.py) - MOA testing suite

## Overview

Mixture of Agents (MOA) patterns combine multiple agents with different capabilities or models to create more robust and capable systems. By leveraging the strengths of different agents, MOA patterns can achieve better performance than individual agents alone.
