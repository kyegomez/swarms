# Swarm Router Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating swarm routing patterns for directing tasks across multiple agent swarms.

## Examples

- [heavy_swarm_router_example.py](heavy_swarm_router_example.py) - Router for heavy swarms
- [market_analysis_swarm_router_concurrent.py](market_analysis_swarm_router_concurrent.py) - Concurrent market analysis router
- [sr_moa_example.py](sr_moa_example.py) - Swarm router with MOA
- [swarm_router_benchmark.py](swarm_router_benchmark.py) - Router performance benchmarking
- [swarm_router_example.py](swarm_router_example.py) - Basic swarm router example
- [swarm_router_test.py](swarm_router_test.py) - Router testing suite
- [swarm_router.py](swarm_router.py) - Core swarm router implementation

## Overview

Swarm routers intelligently distribute tasks across multiple agent swarms based on task characteristics, swarm capabilities, and current load. These examples demonstrate various routing strategies including load balancing, capability matching, and performance optimization.
