# Heavy Swarm Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating heavy swarm patterns for large-scale multi-agent systems.

## Examples

- [heavy_swarm_example_one.py](heavy_swarm_example_one.py) - First heavy swarm example
- [heavy_swarm_example.py](heavy_swarm_example.py) - Main heavy swarm implementation
- [heavy_swarm_no_dashboard.py](heavy_swarm_no_dashboard.py) - Heavy swarm without dashboard
- [heavy_swarm.py](heavy_swarm.py) - Core heavy swarm implementation
- [medical_heavy_swarm_example.py](medical_heavy_swarm_example.py) - Medical heavy swarm

## Overview

Heavy swarms are designed for large-scale multi-agent systems with many agents working on complex tasks. These examples demonstrate patterns for managing large agent populations, coordinating their work, and handling the increased complexity and resource requirements.
