# Forest Swarm Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating forest swarm architectures for multi-agent systems.

## Examples

- [forest_swarm_example.py](forest_swarm_example.py) - Forest-based swarm architecture
- [fund_manager_forest.py](fund_manager_forest.py) - Financial fund management forest
- [medical_forest_swarm.py](medical_forest_swarm.py) - Medical domain forest swarm
- [tree_example.py](tree_example.py) - Basic tree structure example
- [tree_swarm_test.py](tree_swarm_test.py) - Tree swarm testing

## Overview

Forest swarm patterns organize agents in tree structures, enabling hierarchical processing and decision-making. Each branch can handle different aspects of a problem, with results flowing up the tree for final synthesis. This pattern is useful for complex, multi-faceted problems requiring specialized agent teams.
