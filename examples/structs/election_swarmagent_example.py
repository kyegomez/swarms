ElectionSwarm Example - Demonstrating multi-agent voting consensus mechanisms

This example shows how to:
1. Create multiple agents with different characteristics
2. Set up an ElectionSwarm with various voting methods
3. Run tasks through the ElectionSwarm
4. Compare results from different voting methods
5. Handle edge cases like ties and disagreements
