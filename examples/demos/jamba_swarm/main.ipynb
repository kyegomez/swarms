    "**Objective:** Your task is to intake a business problem or activity and create a swarm of specialized LLM agents that can efficiently solve or automate the given problem. You will define the number of agents, specify the tools each agent needs, and describe how they need to work together, including the communication protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intake Business Problem:**\n",
    "   - Receive a detailed description of the business problem or activity to automate.\n",
    "   - Clarify the objectives, constraints, and expected outcomes of the problem.\n",
    "   - Identify key components and sub-tasks within the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agent Design:**\n",
    "   - Based on the problem, determine the number and types of specialized LLM agents required.\n",
    "   - For each agent, specify:\n",
    "     - The specific task or role it will perform.\n",
    "     - The tools and resources it needs to perform its task.\n",
    "     - Any prerequisite knowledge or data it must have access to.\n",
    "   - Ensure that the collective capabilities of the agents cover all aspects of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordination and Communication:**\n",
    "   - Define how the agents will communicate and coordinate with each other.\n",
    "   - Choose the type of communication (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, broadcast, direct messaging).\n",
    "   - Describe the protocol for information sharing, conflict resolution, and task handoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflow Design:**\n",
    "   - Outline the workflow or sequence of actions the agents will follow.\n",
    "   - Define the input and output for each agent.\n",
    "   - Specify the triggers and conditions for transitions between agents or tasks.\n",
    "   - Ensure there are feedback loops and monitoring mechanisms to track progress and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability and Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - Design the system to be scalable, allowing for the addition or removal of agents as needed.\n",
    "   - Ensure flexibility to handle dynamic changes in the problem or environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Specification:**\n",
    "   - Provide a detailed plan including:\n",
    "     - The number of agents and their specific roles.\n",
    "     - The tools and resources each agent will use.\n",
    "     - The communication and coordination strategy.\n",
    "     - The workflow and sequence of actions.\n",
    "   - Include a diagram or flowchart if necessary to visualize the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:** Automate customer support for an e-commerce platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents and Roles:**\n",
    "1. **Customer Query Classifier Agent:**\n",
    "   - Task: Classify incoming customer queries into predefined categories.\n",
    "   - Tools: Natural language processing toolkit, pre-trained classification model.\n",
    "   - Communication: Receives raw queries, sends classified queries to relevant agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Status Agent:**\n",
    "   - Task: Provide order status updates to customers.\n",
    "   - Tools: Access to order database, query processing toolkit.\n",
    "   - Communication: Receives classified queries about order status, responds with relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Product Recommendation Agent:**\n",
    "   - Task: Suggest products to customers based on their query and browsing history.\n",
    "   - Tools: Recommendation engine, access to product database.\n",
    "   - Communication: Receives classified queries about product recommendations, sends personalized suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Technical Support Agent:**\n",
    "   - Task: Assist customers with technical issues.\n",
    "   - Tools: Access to technical support database, troubleshooting toolkit.\n",
    "   - Communication: Receives classified queries about technical issues, provides solutions or escalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Type:** Asynchronous communication through a central message broker.\n",
    "- **Protocol:** Agents publish and subscribe to specific topics related to their tasks. \n",
    "- **Conflict Resolution:** If multiple agents need to handle the same query, a priority protocol is in place to determine the primary responder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Customer Query Classifier Agent receives and classifies the query.\n",
    "2. Classified query is routed to the appropriate specialized agent.\n",
    "3. Specialized agent processes the query and sends a response.\n",
    "4. If needed, the response triggers further actions from other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability and Flexibility:**\n",
    "- Agents can be added or removed based on query volume and complexity.\n",
    "- System adapts to changes in query types and business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Plan:**\n",
    "- Diagram illustrating agent roles and communication flow.\n",
    "- Detailed description of each agent's tasks, tools, and communication methods.\n",
    "- Workflow sequence from query intake to resolution.\n",

For the e-commerce platform, we can specify the names and system prompts for each agent. For instance, the agents can be named 'Product Inquiry Agent', 'Order Status Agent', 'Complaint Resolution Agent', etc. Each agent will have a system prompt tailored to its role.

      "To automate customer support for an e-commerce platform using a swarm of specialized LLM agents, we will follow the outlined structure. Here's the detailed plan: ### 1. **Business Problem Intake:** * **Objective:** Automate customer support to efficiently handle inquiries, complaints, and provide information. * **Constraints:** Real-time response capability, ability to handle a high volume of queries, and integration with the e-commerce platform. * **Expected Outcomes:** Improved customer satisfaction, reduced workload on human customer support agents, and efficient handling of a wide range of customer inquiries. * **Key Components:** Query classification, order status updates, product recommendations, and technical support. ### 2. **Agent Design:** * **Number of Agents:** 4 specialized agents. * **Agent Roles and Tools:** 1. **Query Classifier Agent:** Classifies queries into categories like order status, product inquiries, technical issues, etc. + Tools: Natural language processing toolkit, query categorization model. 2. **Order Status Agent:** Provides updates on order status. + Tools: Access to order database, query processing toolkit. 3. **Product Recommendation Agent:** Suggests products based on customer's query and browsing history. + Tools: Recommendation engine, access to product database. 4. **Technical Support Agent:** Assists with technical issues. + Tools: Access to technical support database, troubleshooting toolkit. ### 3. **Coordination and Communication:** * **Communication Type:** Asynchronous, through a central message broker. * **Communication Protocol:** Agents subscribe to specific topics related to their tasks. * **Conflict Resolution:** Priority protocol for handling the same query by multiple agents. ### 4. **Workflow Design:** * **Workflow Sequence:** 1. Query Classifier Agent receives the query. 2. Classifies the query and routes it to the appropriate agent. 3. Specialized agent processes the query and responds. 4. Response triggers further actions if necessary. * **Inputs/Outputs:** + Query Classifier Agent: Receives raw queries, outputs classified queries. + Order Status Agent: Receives classified queries about order status, outputs order status updates. + Product Recommendation Agent: Receives classified queries about product recommendations, outputs product suggestions. + Technical Support Agent: Receives classified queries about technical issues, outputs solutions or escalations. ### 5. **Scalability and Flexibility:** * Agents can be scaled based on query volume and complexity. * System adapts to changes in query types and business needs. ### 6. **Output Specification:** * **Plan Details:** + Number of Agents: 4 (Query Classifier, Order Status, Product Recommendation, Technical Support). + Tools and Resources: Natural language processing, access to databases, recommendation engines. + Communication and Coordination: Asynchronous communication through a central message broker. + Workflow: Query intake, classification, processing by specialized agents, response generation. * **Visualization:** A diagram illustrating the communication flow and agent roles will be provided. This plan outlines a scalable and flexible system for automating customer support, ensuring efficient handling of diverse customer inquiries while integrating seamlessly with the e-commerce platform. \n"
