# Financial Analysis Skill

When performing financial analysis, follow these systematic steps to ensure thorough and accurate evaluation:

## Core Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Verification
- Gather historical financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Verify data sources for accuracy and completeness
- Identify any anomalies or missing data points

### 2. Financial Ratio Analysis
Calculate and analyze key financial ratios:
- **Profitability**: EBITDA margin, net profit margin, ROE, ROA
- **Liquidity**: Current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio
- **Leverage**: Debt-to-equity, interest coverage ratio
- **Efficiency**: Asset turnover, inventory turnover

### 3. Valuation Models
Build appropriate valuation models:
- **DCF Analysis**: Project free cash flows, determine WACC, calculate terminal value
- **Comparable Company Analysis**: Identify peers, analyze multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
- **Precedent Transactions**: Review similar deals for valuation benchmarks

### 4. Sensitivity Analysis
- Perform scenario analysis (base case, bull case, bear case)
- Test key assumptions (growth rates, discount rates, margins)
- Identify critical value drivers

## Guidelines

- Always use conservative assumptions when uncertain
- Cross-validate findings with multiple valuation methods
- Clearly document all assumptions and their rationale
- Present results with appropriate caveats and risk factors
- Consider both quantitative metrics and qualitative factors

## Key Outputs

Your analysis should produce:
1. Executive summary of findings
2. Detailed financial model with assumptions
3. Valuation range with sensitivity analysis
4. Investment recommendation with risk assessment
5. Supporting charts and visualizations

## Example Use Cases

- **Public Company Valuation**: "Analyze Tesla's financials and provide a DCF valuation"
- **Private Investment**: "Evaluate this startup's unit economics and runway"
- **M&A Analysis**: "Assess the financial implications of this acquisition"
