### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one. `SequentialWorkflow` is Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

-----


### ConcurrentWorkflow

A `ConcurrentWorkflow` runs multiple agents simultaneously, allowing for parallel execution of tasks. This architecture drastically reduces execution time for tasks that can be performed in parallel, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios where agents work on similar tasks concurrently.

```python
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow

# Create agents for different analysis tasks
market_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Market-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Analyze market trends and provide insights on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

financial_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst", 
    system_prompt="Provide financial analysis and recommendations on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

risk_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Risk-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Assess risks and provide risk management strategies for the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", 
    max_loops=1,
)

# Create concurrent workflow
concurrent_workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=[market_analyst, financial_analyst, risk_analyst],
    max_loops=1,
)

# Run all agents concurrently on the same task
results = concurrent_workflow.run(
    "Analyze the potential impact of AI technology on the healthcare industry"
)

print(results)
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax. [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is Perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, sequence, or a combination of both.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the swarm
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```


<!-- 
### GraphWorkflow

`GraphWorkflow` orchestrates tasks using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing you to manage complex dependencies where some tasks must wait for others to complete.

**Description:** Essential for building sophisticated pipelines, like in software development or complex project management, where task order and dependencies are critical.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GraphWorkflow, Node, Edge, NodeType

# Define agents and a simple python function as nodes
code_generator = Agent(agent_name="CodeGenerator", system_prompt="Write Python code for the given task.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
code_tester = Agent(agent_name="CodeTester", system_prompt="Test the given Python code and find bugs.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create nodes for the graph
node1 = Node(id="generator", agent=code_generator)
node2 = Node(id="tester", agent=code_tester)

# Create the graph and define the dependency
graph = GraphWorkflow()
graph.add_nodes([node1, node2])
graph.add_edge(Edge(source="generator", target="tester")) # Tester runs after generator

# Set entry and end points
graph.set_entry_points(["generator"])
graph.set_end_points(["tester"])

# Run the graph workflow
results = graph.run("Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.")
print(results)
``` -->

----

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm. Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

This makes your code cleaner and more flexible, allowing you to switch between different multi-agent strategies with ease. Here's a complete example that shows how to define agents and then use `SwarmRouter` to execute the same task using different collaborative strategies.

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```


The `SwarmRouter` is a powerful tool for simplifying multi-agent orchestration. It provides a consistent and flexible way to deploy different collaborative strategies, allowing you to build more sophisticated applications with less code.

-------

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result. [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

----

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically. This architecture is ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```

----

### HierarchicalSwarm

`HierarchicalSwarm` implements a director-worker pattern where a central director agent creates comprehensive plans and distributes specific tasks to specialized worker agents. The director evaluates results and can issue new orders in feedback loops, making it ideal for complex project management and team coordination scenarios.

```python
from swarms import Agent, HierarchicalSwarm

# Define specialized worker agents
content_strategist = Agent(
    agent_name="Content-Strategist",
    system_prompt="You are a senior content strategist. Develop comprehensive content strategies, editorial calendars, and content roadmaps.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

creative_director = Agent(
    agent_name="Creative-Director", 
    system_prompt="You are a creative director. Develop compelling advertising concepts, visual directions, and campaign creativity.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

seo_specialist = Agent(
    agent_name="SEO-Specialist",
    system_prompt="You are an SEO expert. Conduct keyword research, optimize content, and develop organic growth strategies.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

brand_strategist = Agent(
    agent_name="Brand-Strategist",
    system_prompt="You are a brand strategist. Develop brand positioning, identity systems, and market differentiation strategies.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the hierarchical swarm with a director
marketing_swarm = HierarchicalSwarm(
    name="Marketing-Team-Swarm",
    description="A comprehensive marketing team with specialized agents coordinated by a director",
    agents=[content_strategist, creative_director, seo_specialist, brand_strategist],
    max_loops=2,  # Allow for feedback and refinement
    verbose=True
)

# Run the swarm on a complex marketing challenge
result = marketing_swarm.run(
    "Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new SaaS product launch. "
    "The product is a project management tool targeting small to medium businesses. "
    "Coordinate the team to create content strategy, creative campaigns, SEO optimization, "
    "and brand positioning that work together cohesively."
)

print(result)
```

The `HierarchicalSwarm` excels at:
- **Complex Project Management**: Breaking down large tasks into specialized subtasks
- **Team Coordination**: Ensuring all agents work toward unified goals
- **Quality Control**: Director provides feedback and refinement loops
- **Scalable Workflows**: Easy to add new specialized agents as needed

---

### HeavySwarm

`HeavySwarm` implements a sophisticated 5-phase workflow inspired by X.AI's Grok heavy implementation. It uses specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification) to provide comprehensive task analysis through intelligent question generation, parallel execution, and synthesis. This architecture excels at complex research and analysis tasks requiring thorough investigation and multiple perspectives.

```python
from swarms import HeavySwarm
