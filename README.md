A **Swarm** consists of multiple agents working together. This simple example creates a two-agent workflow for researching and writing a blog post. [Learn More About SequentialWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)

```

### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one. `SequentialWorkflow` is Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

-----


### ConcurrentWorkflow

A `ConcurrentWorkflow` runs multiple agents simultaneously, allowing for parallel execution of tasks. This architecture drastically reduces execution time for tasks that can be performed in parallel, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios where agents work on similar tasks concurrently.

```python
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow

# Create agents for different analysis tasks
market_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Market-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Analyze market trends and provide insights on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

financial_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst", 
    system_prompt="Provide financial analysis and recommendations on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

risk_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Risk-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Assess risks and provide risk management strategies for the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", 
    max_loops=1,
)

# Create concurrent workflow
concurrent_workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=[market_analyst, financial_analyst, risk_analyst],
    max_loops=1,
)

# Run all agents concurrently on the same task
results = concurrent_workflow.run(
    "Analyze the potential impact of AI technology on the healthcare industry"
)

print(results)
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax. [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, in sequence, or in any combination you choose.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the swarm
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```


<!-- 
### GraphWorkflow

`GraphWorkflow` orchestrates tasks using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing you to manage complex dependencies where some tasks must wait for others to complete.

**Description:** Essential for building sophisticated pipelines, like in software development or complex project management, where task order and dependencies are critical.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GraphWorkflow, Node, Edge, NodeType

# Define agents and a simple python function as nodes
code_generator = Agent(agent_name="CodeGenerator", system_prompt="Write Python code for the given task.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
code_tester = Agent(agent_name="CodeTester", system_prompt="Test the given Python code and find bugs.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create nodes for the graph
node1 = Node(id="generator", agent=code_generator)
node2 = Node(id="tester", agent=code_tester)

# Create the graph and define the dependency
graph = GraphWorkflow()
graph.add_nodes([node1, node2])
graph.add_edge(Edge(source="generator", target="tester")) # Tester runs after generator

# Set entry and end points
graph.set_entry_points(["generator"])
graph.set_end_points(["tester"])

# Run the graph workflow
results = graph.run("Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.")
print(results)
``` -->

----

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm. Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

This makes your code cleaner and more flexible, allowing you to switch between different multi-agent strategies with ease. Here's a complete example that shows how to define agents and then use `SwarmRouter` to execute the same task using different collaborative strategies.

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```


The `SwarmRouter` is a powerful tool for simplifying multi-agent orchestration. It provides a consistent and flexible way to deploy different collaborative strategies, allowing you to build more sophisticated applications with less code.

-------

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result. [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

----

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically. This architecture is ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

    name="Marketing-Team-Swarm",
    description="A comprehensive marketing team with specialized agents coordinated by a director",
    agents=[content_strategist, creative_director, seo_specialist, brand_strategist],
    max_loops=2,  # Allow for feedback and refinement
    verbose=True
)

# Run the swarm on a complex marketing challenge
result = marketing_swarm.run(
    "Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for a new SaaS product launch. "
    "The product is a project management tool targeting small to medium businesses. "
    "Coordinate the team to create content strategy, creative campaigns, SEO optimization, "
    "and brand positioning that work together cohesively."
)

print(result)
```

The `HierarchicalSwarm` excels at:
- **Complex Project Management**: Breaking down large tasks into specialized subtasks

    loops_per_agent=1,
    agent_prints_on=False,
    worker_tools=[exa_search],
    random_loops_per_agent=True,
)

prompt = (
    "Find the best 3 gold ETFs. For each ETF, provide the ticker symbol, "
    "full name, current price, expense ratio, assets under management, and "
    "a brief explanation of why it is considered among the best. Present the information "
    "in a clear, structured format suitable for investors. Scrape the data from the web. "
)

out = swarm.run(prompt)
print(out)

```

The `HeavySwarm` provides:

- **5-Phase Analysis**: Question generation, research, analysis, alternatives, and verification

- **Specialized Agents**: Each phase uses purpose-built agents for optimal results

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives and thorough investigation

### Social Algorithms

**Social Algorithms** provide a flexible framework for defining custom communication patterns between agents. You can upload any arbitrary social algorithm as a callable that defines the sequence of communication, enabling agents to talk to each other in sophisticated ways. [Learn more about Social Algorithms](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/social_algorithms/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, SocialAlgorithms

# Define a custom social algorithm
def research_analysis_synthesis_algorithm(agents, task, **kwargs):
    # Agent 1 researches the topic
    research_result = agents[0].run(f"Research: {task}")
    
    # Agent 2 analyzes the research
    analysis = agents[1].run(f"Analyze this research: {research_result}")
    
    # Agent 3 synthesizes the findings
    synthesis = agents[2].run(f"Synthesize: {research_result} + {analysis}")
    
    return {
        "research": research_result,
        "analysis": analysis,
        "synthesis": synthesis
    }

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
  agent_name="Researcher",
  agent_description="Expert in comprehensive research and information gathering.",
  model_name="gpt-4.1"
)
analyst = Agent(
  agent_name="Analyst",
  agent_description="Specialist in analyzing and interpreting data.",
  model_name="gpt-4.1"
)
synthesizer = Agent(
  agent_name="Synthesizer",
  agent_description="Focused on synthesizing and integrating research insights.",
  model_name="gpt-4.1"
)

# Create social algorithm
social_alg = SocialAlgorithms(
    name="Research-Analysis-Synthesis",
    agents=[researcher, analyst, synthesizer],
    social_algorithm=research_analysis_synthesis_algorithm,
    verbose=True
)

# Run the algorithm
result = social_alg.run("The impact of AI on healthcare")
print(result.final_outputs)
```

Perfect for implementing complex multi-agent workflows, collaborative problem-solving, and custom communication protocols.

### Agent Orchestration Protocol (AOP)

The **Agent Orchestration Protocol (AOP)** is a powerful framework for deploying and managing agents as distributed services. AOP enables agents to be discovered, managed, and executed through a standardized protocol, making it perfect for building scalable multi-agent systems. [Learn more about AOP](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/aop/)

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.aop import AOP

# Create specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Research-Agent",
    agent_description="Expert in research and data collection",
    model_name="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_loops=1,
    tags=["research", "data-collection", "analysis"],
    capabilities=["web-search", "data-gathering", "report-generation"],
    role="researcher"
)

analysis_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Analysis-Agent", 
    agent_description="Expert in data analysis and insights",
    model_name="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_loops=1,
    tags=["analysis", "data-processing", "insights"],
    capabilities=["statistical-analysis", "pattern-recognition", "visualization"],
    role="analyst"
)

# Create AOP server
deployer = AOP(
    server_name="ResearchCluster",
    port=8000,
    verbose=True
)

# Add agents to the server
deployer.add_agent(
    agent=research_agent,
    tool_name="research_tool",
    tool_description="Research and data collection tool",
    timeout=30,
    max_retries=3
)

deployer.add_agent(
    agent=analysis_agent,
    tool_name="analysis_tool", 
    tool_description="Data analysis and insights tool",
    timeout=30,
    max_retries=3
)

# List all registered agents
print("Registered agents:", deployer.list_agents())

# Start the AOP server
deployer.run()
```

Perfect for deploying large scale multi-agent systems. [Read the complete AOP documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/aop/)
