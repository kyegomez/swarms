## `Agent` Class
The `Agent` class is a fundamental component of the Swarms framework, designed to execute tasks autonomously. It fuses llms, tools and long-term memory capabilities to create a full stack agent. The `Agent` class is highly customizable, allowing for fine-grained control over its behavior and interactions.


### `run` Method
The `run` method is the primary entry point for executing tasks with an `Agent` instance. It accepts a task string as the main input task and processes it according to the agent's configuration. And, it can also accept an `img` parameter such as `img="image_filepath.png` to process images if you have a VLM attached such as `GPT4VisionAPI`



## Simple Example

```python
from swarms import Agent

agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Stock-Analysis-Agent",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops="auto",
    interactive=True,
    streaming_on=True,
)

agent.run("What is the current market trend for tech stocks?")

```

### Settings and Customization
The `Agent` class offers a range of settings to tailor its behavior to specific needs. Some key settings include:

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_name` | The name of the agent. | "DefaultAgent" |
| `system_prompt` | The system prompt to use for the agent. | "Default system prompt." |
| `llm` | The language model to use for processing tasks. | `OpenAIChat` instance |
| `max_loops` | The maximum number of loops to execute for a task. | 1 |
| `autosave` | Enables or disables autosaving of the agent's state. | False |
| `dashboard` | Enables or disables the dashboard for the agent. | False |
| `verbose` | Controls the verbosity of the agent's output. | False |
| `dynamic_temperature_enabled` | Enables or disables dynamic temperature adjustment for the language model. | False |
| `saved_state_path` | The path to save the agent's state. | "agent_state.json" |
| `user_name` | The username associated with the agent. | "default_user" |
| `retry_attempts` | The number of retry attempts for failed tasks. | 1 |
| `context_length` | The maximum length of the context to consider for tasks. | 200000 |
| `return_step_meta` | Controls whether to return step metadata in the output. | False |
| `output_type` | The type of output to return (e.g., "json", "string"). | "string" |


```python
import os
from swarms import Agent

from swarms.prompts.finance_agent_sys_prompt import (
    FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
)
# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analysis-Agent",
    system_prompt=FINANCIAL_AGENT_SYS_PROMPT,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    verbose=True,
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    saved_state_path="finance_agent.json",
    user_name="swarms_corp",
    retry_attempts=1,
    context_length=200000,
    return_step_meta=False,
    output_type="string",
    streaming_on=False,
)


agent.run(
    "How can I establish a ROTH IRA to buy stocks and get a tax break? What are the criteria"
)

```

### `Agent`with Pydantic BaseModel as Output Type
The following is an example of an agent that intakes a pydantic basemodel and outputs it at the same time:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from swarms import Agent


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(..., title="Whether the person is a student")
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = Schema(
    name="Tool Name",
    agent=1,
    is_student=True,
    courses=["Course1", "Course2"],
)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Person Information Generator",
    system_prompt=(
        "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
    ),
    # Set the tool schema to the JSON string -- this is the key difference
    tool_schema=tool_schema,
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=3,
    autosave=True,
    dashboard=False,
    streaming_on=True,
    verbose=True,
    interactive=True,
    # Set the output type to the tool schema which is a BaseModel
    output_type=tool_schema,  # or dict, or str
    metadata_output_type="json",
    # List of schemas that the agent can handle
    list_base_models=[tool_schema],
    function_calling_format_type="OpenAI",
    function_calling_type="json",  # or soon yaml
)

# Run the agent to generate the person's information
generated_data = agent.run(task)

# Print the generated data
print(f"Generated data: {generated_data}")


```

### Multi Modal Autonomous Agent
Run the agent with multiple modalities useful for various real-world tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and health.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from swarms import Agent

from swarm_models import GPT4VisionAPI

# Load the environment variables
load_dotenv()


# Initialize the language model
llm = GPT4VisionAPI(
    openai_api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    max_tokens=500,
)

# Initialize the task
task = (
    "Analyze this image of an assembly line and identify any issues such as"
    " misaligned parts, defects, or deviations from the standard assembly"
    " process. IF there is anything unsafe in the image, explain why it is"
    " unsafe and how it could be improved."
)
img = "assembly_line.jpg"

## Initialize the workflow
agent = Agent(
    agent_name = "Multi-ModalAgent",
    llm=llm, 
    max_loops="auto", 
    autosave=True, 
    dashboard=True, 
    multi_modal=True
)

# Run the workflow on a task
agent.run(task, img)
```
----


### Local Agent `ToolAgent`
ToolAgent is an fully local agent that can use tools through JSON function calling. It intakes any open source model from huggingface and is extremely modular and plug in and play. We need help adding general support to all models soon.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

from swarms import ToolAgent
from swarms.tools.json_utils import base_model_to_json

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dolly-v2-12b",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    device_map="auto",
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dolly-v2-12b")


# Initialize the schema for the person's information
class Schema(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Name of the person")
    agent: int = Field(..., title="Age of the person")
    is_student: bool = Field(
        ..., title="Whether the person is a student"
    )
    courses: list[str] = Field(
        ..., title="List of courses the person is taking"
    )


# Convert the schema to a JSON string
tool_schema = base_model_to_json(Schema)

# Define the task to generate a person's information
task = (
    "Generate a person's information based on the following schema:"
)

# Create an instance of the ToolAgent class
agent = ToolAgent(
    name="dolly-function-agent",
    description="Ana gent to create a child data",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    json_schema=tool_schema,
)

# Run the agent to generate the person's information
generated_data = agent.run(task)

# Print the generated data
print(f"Generated data: {generated_data}")

```


## Understanding Swarms

A swarm refers to a group of more than two agents working collaboratively to achieve a common goal. These agents can be software entities, such as llms that interact with each other to perform complex tasks. The concept of a swarm is inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks, where simple individual behaviors lead to complex group dynamics and problem-solving capabilities.

### How Swarm Architectures Facilitate Communication

Swarm architectures are designed to establish and manage communication between agents within a swarm. These architectures define how agents interact, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Here are some key aspects of swarm architectures:

1. **Hierarchical Communication**: In hierarchical swarms, communication flows from higher-level agents to lower-level agents. Higher-level agents act as coordinators, distributing tasks and aggregating results. This structure is efficient for tasks that require top-down control and decision-making.

2. **Parallel Communication**: In parallel swarms, agents operate independently and communicate with each other as needed. This architecture is suitable for tasks that can be processed concurrently without dependencies, allowing for faster execution and scalability.

3. **Sequential Communication**: Sequential swarms process tasks in a linear order, where each agent's output becomes the input for the next agent. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled in the correct sequence, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.


Swarm architectures leverage these communication patterns to ensure that agents work together efficiently, adapting to the specific requirements of the task at hand. By defining clear communication protocols and interaction models, swarm architectures enable the seamless orchestration of multiple agents, leading to enhanced performance and problem-solving capabilities.

### `SequentialWorkflow`
Sequential Workflow enables you to sequentially execute tasks with `Agent` and then pass the output into the next agent and onwards until you have specified your max loops.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent 1] --> B[Agent 2]
    B --> C[Agent 3]
    C --> D[Agent 4]
    D --> E[Max Loops]
    E --> F[End]
```



### Methods

| Method | Description | Parameters | Return Value |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| `__init__` | Initialize the SequentialWorkflow | `agents`: List of Agent objects<br>`max_loops`: Maximum number of iterations<br>`verbose`: Boolean for verbose output | None |
| `run` | Execute the workflow | `input_data`: Initial input for the first agent | Final output after all agents have processed |

### Inputs

| Input | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `agents` | List[Agent] | List of Agent objects to be executed sequentially |
| `max_loops` | int | Maximum number of times the entire sequence will be repeated |
| `verbose` | bool | If True, print detailed information during execution |

### Output

The `run` method returns the final output after all agents have processed the input sequentially.

In this example, each `Agent` represents a task that is executed sequentially. The output of each agent is passed to the next agent in the sequence until the maximum number of loops is reached. This workflow is particularly useful for tasks that require a series of steps to be executed in a specific order, such as data processing pipelines or complex calculations that rely on the output of previous steps.

## `AgentRearrange`

The `AgentRearrange` orchestration technique, inspired by Einops and einsum, allows you to define and map out the relationships between various agents. It provides a powerful tool for orchestrating complex workflows, enabling you to specify linear and sequential relationships such as `a -> a1 -> a2 -> a3`, or concurrent relationships where the first agent sends a message to 3 agents simultaneously: `a -> a1, a2, a3`. This level of customization allows for the creation of highly efficient and dynamic workflows, where agents can work in parallel or in sequence as needed. The `AgentRearrange` technique is a valuable addition to the swarms library, providing a new level of flexibility and control over the orchestration of agents. For more detailed information and examples, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/).

It enables the creation of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between tasks and agents. This allows for efficient task assignment, execution, and monitoring.

Here's a breakdown of how the `GraphSwarm` works:

1. **Node Creation**: The `GraphSwarm` workflow is composed of nodes, which can be either agents or tasks. Agents are responsible for executing tasks, and tasks represent specific operations that need to be performed. In the example, two agents (`agent1` and `agent2`) and one task (`task1`) are created.
2. **Edge Definition**: Edges are used to define the relationships between nodes. In this case, edges are created to connect `agent1` and `agent2` to `task1`, indicating that both agents are capable of executing `task1`.
3. **Entry and End Points**: The `GraphSwarm` workflow requires the definition of entry points (where the workflow starts) and end points (where the workflow concludes). In this example, `agent1` and `agent2` are set as entry points, and `task1` is set as the end point.
4. **Visualization**: The `GraphSwarm` provides a visualization feature to graphically represent the workflow. This allows for easy understanding and debugging of the workflow structure.
5. **Execution**: The `GraphSwarm` workflow is executed by traversing the graph from the entry points to the end points. In this case, both `agent1` and `agent2` execute `task1` concurrently, and the results are collected.
6. **Results**: The final results of the workflow execution are aggregated and returned. In this example, the result of executing `task1` is "Task completed".

The `GraphSwarm` offers several benefits, including:

* **Concurrency**: Enables the execution of tasks concurrently, improving overall workflow efficiency.
* **Flexibility**: Allows for dynamic task assignment based on agent availability and task requirements.
* **Scalability**: Supports the addition of new agents and tasks as needed, making it suitable for large-scale workflows.
* **Visualization**: Provides a graphical representation of the workflow, facilitating understanding and debugging.

By leveraging the `GraphSwarm`, complex workflows can be efficiently managed, and tasks can be executed in a coordinated and scalable manner.

## `ForestSwarm`
The `ForestSwarm` architecture is designed for efficient task assignment by dynamically selecting the most suitable agent from a collection of trees. This is achieved through asynchronous task processing, where agents are chosen based on their relevance to the task at hand. The relevance is determined by calculating the similarity between the system prompts associated with each agent and the keywords present in the task itself. For a more in-depth understanding of how `ForestSwarm` works, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/forest_swarm/).

## `SwarmRouter`
The `SwarmRouter` class is a flexible routing system designed to manage different types of swarms for task execution. It provides a unified interface to interact with various swarm types, including `AgentRearrange`, `MixtureOfAgents`, `SpreadSheetSwarm`, `SequentialWorkflow`, and `ConcurrentWorkflow`. We will be continuously adding more and more swarm architectures here as we progress with new architectures.

#### Attributes:
- `name` (str): Name of the SwarmRouter instance.
- `description` (str): Description of the SwarmRouter instance.
- `max_loops` (int): Maximum number of loops to perform.
- `agents` (List[Agent]): List of Agent objects to be used in the swarm.
- `swarm_type` (SwarmType): Type of swarm to be used.
- `swarm` (Union[AgentRearrange, MixtureOfAgents, SpreadSheetSwarm, SequentialWorkflow, ConcurrentWorkflow]): Instantiated swarm object.
- `logs` (List[SwarmLog]): List of log entries captured during operations.

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self, name: str, description: str, max_loops: int, agents: List[Agent], swarm_type: SwarmType, *args, **kwargs)`: Initialize the SwarmRouter.
- `_create_swarm(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Create and return the specified swarm type.
- `_log(self, level: str, message: str, task: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any])`: Create a log entry and add it to the logs list.
- `run(self, task: str, *args, **kwargs)`: Run the specified task on the selected swarm.
- `get_logs(self)`: Retrieve all logged entries.

### Changing Swarm Types

You can create multiple SwarmRouter instances with different swarm types:

```python
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="SequentialRouter",
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow
)

concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="ConcurrentRouter",
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow
)
```

### AgentRearrange

Use Case: Optimizing agent order for complex multi-step tasks.

```python
rearrange_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="TaskOptimizer",
    description="Optimize agent order for multi-step tasks",
    max_loops=3,
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.AgentRearrange,
    flow = f"{data_extractor.name} -> {analyzer.name} -> {summarizer.name}"
)

result = rearrange_router.run("Analyze and summarize the quarterly financial report")
```

### MixtureOfAgents

Use Case: Combining diverse expert agents for comprehensive analysis.

```python
mixture_router = SwarmRouter(
    name="ExpertPanel",
    description="Combine insights from various expert agents",
    max_loops=1,
    agents=[
        data_extractor_agent,
        summarizer_agent,
        financial_analyst_agent,
        market_analyst_agent,
        operational_analyst_agent,
    ],
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents
)

result = mixture_router.run("Evaluate the potential acquisition of TechStartup Inc.")
```

## Folder Structure
The swarms package has been meticlously crafted for extreme use-ability and understanding, the swarms package is split up into various modules such as `swarms.agents` that holds pre-built agents, `swarms.structs`¬†that holds a vast array of structures like `Agent` and multi agent structures. The 3 most important are `structs`, `models`, and `agents`.

```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models -> swarm_models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ structs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ telemetry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils
